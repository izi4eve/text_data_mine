[Music] Christmas The Most Wonderful Time of the Year with the most festive movies of the year but not all Christmas movies are created equally on one side you have the theatrical studio Christmas movie we're talking your eles we're talking your home alone you're the Santa Clauses these films aren't Blockbusters per se their budgets are often medium to small but they're significant when compared to the micro-budget Christmas movies that our moms have grown to love like time for him to come home for Christmas or time for me to come home for Christmas or time for you to come home for Christmas or time for us to come home for Christmas or a cookie cutter Christmas okay that last one was a departure I know but I lumped it in because I actually spoke to the guy who made the music for it hey I'm Russ Howard and I am a film composer almost every day on Hallmark during Christmas season there's a good chance if you turn on the TV then you you'll run into some of my music I called him up to talk about how all the Christmas movies we know and love and the ones we might not know yet sound Christmasy like many things those decisions start with money while Studio film budgets are in this range Hallmark movies are generally made for $2 million and under although I think most of them are shot for maybe like 4 to 500,000 and and less when it comes to music only a small percentage of the all budget is allocated for it traditionally it's about 3 to 5% 3% being more the average and then if it's a very s heavy movie that would push it up to that 5% let's take elf as an example it cost roughly $33 million to make 5% of that is just over 1.6 million more than the whole budget of some Hallmark films so they were able to afford a scene like this where Zoe dianel and will Ferell sing a popular song can't which uh I can't actually play more than that here for fear of getting flagged for copyright infringement but anyways songs like that one cost a pretty penny and just how much is a pretty penny well I emailed a bunch of music supervisors to try and find out and one got back to me Lexi Brewer she mostly works on the cable TV side of things and via email she told me that the traditional Christmas songs we know and love tend to cost somewhere in the ballpark of $25,000 per side per side is important to note here because when you want to license a song for a movie there's actually two sides to every clearance like let's say you want us to play Christmas baby please come home in your movie I don't know if I know that one exactly you definitely do someone that's like Christmas the snow's coming down oh yes of course um editor notes to uh Michael blueblade darling love and anyone else who sings this song Please Don't sue us for doing that the first Fe you have have to pay is for the composition of the song using those notes in that order $25,000 or thereabouts goes to the music publisher the second feed depends on what those notes in that order sound like you could have the original recording or the cover by Michael bl√© either way you need to square up for at least another 25k but depending on the song The Artist might want more and then the overall cost increases Lexi explain with this example of Mariah Carey if she wanted twice as much as the traditional rate on her side then the other side would likely match doubling the total feet of course these are all loose numbers these kinds of deals generally aren't made public and Lexi works on the TV side of things she didn't know the numbers specifically but she said that streaming and Theatrical fees are likely more expensive so that might not be exactly what Mariah or other artists might charge which is why you would hear other artists covering Beetles songs a lot of times because they could pay for the right to use the song but not for the right to use the Beatles not less thany music ahead of time can get you into some sticky situations like Russ was telling me about this one time where a rough cut for a film that he was working on for Hallmark had a scene where character sang Rudolph the Red-nose Reindeer you know I get to be the bucket of cold ice water on their Christmas dreams and say hey guys like these songs very well could cost more than the movie budget you know to license they ended up cutting that scene from the film but if they would have known what songs do and don't have copyright there's a way that they could have made a similar scene for free a lot of the Christmas songs we love are not what we call public domain public domain or in other words free from copyright it's the reason that you hear this song in so many movies you know this going be a lot easier if we were facing the way EAS facing the other [Music] way what have you done when it comes to public domain in the US every piece of creative work made before 1928 is totally open for anyone to use anything created after that for the most part is AOK 70 years after the creator dies so this song you're hearing right now it was written by chaikovsky for the n cracker in 1892 public domain what's great about the public domain Christmas songs is it's this like shared cultural experience that we all have these cost nothing and are Christmas as heck they're used in movies big I'm sorry I'm late I was what the what is that and small white and because they're open to the public composers like us can recompose bits and pieces with no worries about having to pay a huge fee or even worse getting sued the trick is recomposing them to fit the mood of a particular scene if I was going to take like Joy to the World and then I wanted to make it maybe a little more Moody I would [Music] maybe my job is like how do I take that and make it work to a scene this is Deck the Halls fit for a baking [Music] Montage but for me the most interesting rearrangements of these classic songs are the more warped ones Russell's able to make Sinister versions of songs we know and love for the Christmas slasher It's a Wonderful [Music] [Applause] knife Joy to the World in like kind of like an evil version did you dtune the bells too yes yeah they're they're a little bit D- tuned so they sound a little bit off there are many ways to we arrange the classic songs we all know and love but sometimes the cheat code to the Christmas sound can boil down to a simple instrument tinkling bells and then of course but it seems like no matter how you get there the most effective way to spread Christmas cheer is public domain Christmas songs for all to hear as we wrap up this festive
