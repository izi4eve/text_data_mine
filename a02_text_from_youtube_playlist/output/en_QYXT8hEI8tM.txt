all right I guess we should just say what's going on we thought it'd be a good time to talk about a part of the Apollo 11 mission that often gets overlooked which was the quarantine including time in a refitted Airstream trailer and a lab you're gonna get to see some of the engineering that NASA's really famous for but applied to a totally different problem which is how do you keep a lunar plague from hitting the earth yeah we've done a few other episodes of this where one of us knows something the other doesn't this time we've all just been cramming on quarantine facts about this Apollo 11 quarantine and seeing so many men in like short-sleeved shirts and we're gonna talk to Amy title from vintage space that came about Phil and I both really like so yeah this is the quarantine edition of history club yay I wanted to talk about the stuff before we get with Amy though like about that period of like 20th century and vaccinations in general the moon-landing is happening in July of 1969 it was coming off to music time in the middle of 20th century measles mumps polio he's had all been beaten back and like we felt pretty good about being able to contain potential diseases even though it's extremely low probability that anything contaminant was on the moon if there was even a chance that they could bring something back it would be truly novel and potentially devastating to life on Earth can you see that yeah oh wait this is the quote that I love they will be treated not as heroes but as bearers of the most virulent devastating plague the world has ever known I love that M plague is spelled wrong this is how venom in spider-man got to earth so this is important stuff this is an idea that we've become very familiar with now because we have the corona virus so dangerous is because no humans ever had it before and if there were an alien lunar plague no human had ever had it before so it's it's kind of the same threat which is why they took no chances and put them in quarantine it's a very blunt approach but it's really interesting that that was kind of like this is our surest bet they've developed the need for this quarantine and then they've got this problem of how to adjust eclis make it happen to get these astronauts from the middle of the ocean all the way to the lunar receiving laboratory environment at all yes in theory in theory Pete will be in the background IP I Pete nice to meet you yeah I gave him some catnip so he's like a little bit stoned right now it's pretty fun so this first clip that I have is let me load it up [Music] so what they're practicing is they want to get the astronauts out of the command module and onto a helicopter basically with as little contamination as possible to try to preserve this quarantine it makes sense that they had to train to do this but it's still crazy to think about it that like you're going through this excitement of being about to go to the moon and your training for how you're gonna get in desert quarantine suit but it does make sense I mean how bad would it be if like the mission went off beautifully everything was great like rah rah America landing on the moon and then they get back and they forget to put on the suit right and like someone falls in the ocean and then everyone gets sick like womp womp that'd be big damper so I kind of get it it's actually from when they were training with the b.i.g suits or big suits and that's the biological isolation garment right yeah um I've only read it so I I don't know how it was pronounced in conversation they'd be way too cumbersome to not just say big suit you know right especially NASA the land of the acronym yeah so here they're all just kind of chilling waiting to go through the trainings I do love how much all this footage shows like being an astronaut is a lot of sitting and listening quietly yeah it looked like they brought it down upside down - yeah they dumped it upside down and then inflate the balloons to flip it laid it and that flotation collar is exactly what it sounds like it is ABS buoyancy and gives them a platform to step out of cuz again like we learned from Gus Grissom in 1961 right when his hatch blew early and the capsule filled with water and sunk he kind of need to give some kind of barrier from the water rushing into this capsule otherwise again you end on a very poor note after a great mission there's a very large issue with the whole quarantine thing in this move of like you just opened the capsule quarantine for Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 as well started the moment they closed the hatch after the lunar EBA the moonwalk so everything that had been exposed was sealed up and of course on the way back you're not opening the capsule at all there's nothing to introduce anything new no one's interacting with it so you've got this thing that's been sealed for like four days and then you just like open it up to the air and then reseal it like it's a bit of a weak link in the chain there but there was no better option they also they sprayed them down right they like threw the suits in put them on and then sprayed them with chemicals and so and so here that's them they've gotten out they're wearing the b.i.g suits and this is this is just a practice run but this is pretty much how it happens in and so then the next stage of their journey is they're in their big suits and then they make it onto the USS Hornet which is a big aircraft carrier and their goal is to enter the mobile quarantine facility so that is the next video that I have lined up here that's why up here it says Hornet plus three on me mobile quarantine facility because they're sort of the astronauts are the additional three were on the porting oh wait I think this is the clip when they walk out of their suits the guy just in a tie just sprays it down after a blow I love that and so the people who went in there it was it was a dr. William carpenter and then John Harris Aki was like the project engineer basically and so those two guys are going inside in the hey Nina with these astronauts for the entire period that the mobile quarantine facility is traveling according to this and all of the stuff that was not human would be flown directly to the lunar receiving laboratory you want to kind of get that there as quickly as possible so that can get into a small plane and flown from the carrier deck ship meanwhile has to go to a base it has to dock somewhere at which point the mqf will be mobile as its name this very fancy Li named thing was just a converted Airstream trailer so that gives you a sense of how not big it was yeah because they had to put it on a plane and a ship and and drive it around the bottom of this plane opens and you just kind of roll this thing in and then you fly it to Euston [Music] [Applause] Gale Armstrong played ukulele of it and there's a great picture of him and I think it's through the glass in that window that Nixon was talking them through it's got this like ghostly artifact in it that gives it this like ethereal feel almost so just like he's he's in this little suit just kind of sitting there just like low-key strumming ukulele about the NQF they also like adjusted the air pressure right so it'd be lower pressure inside so if there was a leak air would go in but not out yeah they did regulate it that way and they've got these like souped up bars on the bottom right like like they dish the wheels and they had to like reinforce it structurally oh and they had a microwave which is very new right in 1969 that's like a high-tech innovation the mini fridge this is looking like a bit like a college dorm [Music] they're landing at the lunar receiving laboratory or lrl which is in Houston it was especially built near the John Cook is now the Johnson Space Center that was like one of the most state-of-the-art Florentina Bowl facilities even the staff that went in had to go through like UV showers and you could not have any medical thing you couldn't be pregnant to work in there everything was super sterile anyone that was interacting with the crew had to be very very clean and very healthy to make sure that the crew did not get sick but also that they did not get you sick is this the press room right here yeah where they're celebrating his birthday that's the press room yeah so you can see like it looks like on the other side of the wall are a bunch of women so probably the wives and family so they can be there and celebrate but they can't actually be in the same space but in this side of the glass were where we are watching from is the clean facility and this is where they are celebrating Neil Armstrong's 39th birthday because he was still in quarantine when that happened this is so cute I've never actually seen this footage of them making the cake I've seen him cutting and serving the cake it's this awesome if there was found to be something potentially bad in one of the samples or if the crew got sick and there was some containment breach of the sick party everyone who worked in the lrl signed a waiver saying they agreed if they were exposed to a contaminant that they would quarantine themselves for an indefinite period afterwards as directed by NASA there's a lot in this like the medical offices there's a lot of beds there's a lot of tables and things in the offices and living space like that's a lot of people and if the second diagram shows you that that's a third of the area of the entire LRL like this is a big space for a lot of people to live and work in addition to the quarantine of the astronauts what kind of experiments are going on in the other half of the lunar receiving laboratory doing were looking at the rocks and classifying the rocks bio classifying if need be to figure out exactly what they had gotten and figure out what's gonna happen with these samples next I think Apollo 11 didn't bring back to too much because they all did one short a VA later missions brought back a lot more and so I got I found some pretty crazy tables of some of the tests that they did on the biological elements I I'm gonna tell you all this one of the experiments they did was they round up some moon rocks made a formula out of it and injected it into a Japanese quail just to see if it made the bird sick like why were they gonna do that to humans hey I mean did they do they think moon moon rock dust is gonna be the new lake street drug like dragged all the kids are on moon dust and I mean I think that's pretty much what they did to the mice too [Music] they spend their time in the lunar receiving laboratory and then they get out they go on this world tour everything's fine hip-hip-hooray [Music] is there anything about the Apollo 11 quarantine either procedurally or like kind of the context of how people were feeling about it at the time that we didn't talk about how much NASA learned over its relatively short existence before Apollo 11s launch to anticipate the worst and hope for the best [Music] anticipating the crew dying at lunch anticipating the crew dying I mean there were abort procedures for every mission stage there were speeches for if they died on the moon down to what do we do if they pick up something deadly in space I think it really speaks to how many people have to be involved to predict or to prepare for something like this it speaks to how well NASA really thought outside the box especially after the Apollo 1 fire to anticipate everything that could possibly go wrong and put everything in place to mitigate that so that if the worst happened they would at least be the best prepared you know the lrl was was built purposely for bringing them back from the moon it was not like let's just outfit this building this was a custom facility for this need and it's it's a lot of planning a lot of preparation but a lot of like acknowledging just how bad things could be to hopefully never have to get there [Music] people find you on YouTube and you've also released a book what is that about it's called fighting for space I always have to read my own subtitle the two pilots and their historical battle for female spaceflight and it's effectively a dual biography of two pilots who were navigating being professional fliers at a time when it was not common for women to be professional pilots and while America was making the transition from aviation to spaceflight and what that meant for women that wanted to be involved
