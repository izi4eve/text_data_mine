if you upload a photo into Google's reverse image search it'll find websites where that picture has appeared or provide visually similar images that have the same coloring and Composition the leading search engine in Russia called Yandex has reverse image search too but it doesn't work the same way it's not looking for visually similar images it's looking for similar faces the same face the difference between these search engines is that Google hasn't switched on facial recognition and Yandex has on Google you can enter a name and look for a face but on Yandex you can enter a face and look for a name and that distinction represents a potentially enormous shift in our offline lives where we usually decide who we introduce ourselves to now that computer scientists have created tools that can turn faces into nametags it's worth reflecting on how we got here and what we stand to lose [Music] a computer's facial recognition system has broadly the same components as your own facial recognition system you see someone with your eyes your mind processes the features of their face and recalls their identity from your memory now imagine if you could have eyes and lots of places and could download and store memories from other people then you have something more like the automated version of facial recognition which has only come together in the past five years or so its eyes our digital cameras revolutionary machines that turn light into data it's a state-of-the-art digital model which records images on memory chips instead of photographic film digital imagery arose in the early 2000s which coincided with the arrival of the social internet so right when we were able to take an unlimited number of pictures Facebook Flickr YouTube and other sites told us that our images had a home online a hundred million photos are being tagged every day on Facebook professional photography also went up on websites news articles and photo libraries and Google's web crawlers gathered them into image search and then the computer vision researchers went to work the millions of digital photos posted to the internet like the Facebook pictures where we tagged our friends or the Google image results of celebrities they were used to build the mind of facial recognition systems that mind is made up of a series of algorithms they locate faces in an image map facial features to correct forehead rotation and then take over a hundred measurements that define that individual face those measurements are usually described as the distance between the eyes the length of the nose the width of the mouth but the truth is nobody knows exactly what's being measured that's determined by a deep learning algorithm looking for correlations in raw pixel data to train that algorithm engineers give it sets of triplets an anchor photo another photo of the same person and a photo of a different person the algorithm is tasked with deciding what to measure so that the statistical difference between the two matching photos is as small as possible while the distance between the non matching photos is as large as possible these algorithms are refined through millions of examples but they still don't perform equally well on all types of people or all types of photos that hasn't stopped them from being packaged and distributed as ready to use software but whoever uses that software won't be able to identify you until you're in their database of known faces that's the memory of the system and it's separate from the training images in the case of the iPhone space ID it's a database of one you volunteer to store your face on your device in exchange for easily unlocking your phone companies like Facebook and Google also keep databases of their users but it's governments that typically have access to the largest databases of names and faces so facial recognition significantly expands the power of the state they collected these images for other reasons and now they're repurposing them for facial recognition without telling us or obtaining our consent which is why several US cities have banned government use of facial recognition in the private sector retail stores banks and stadiums can create or buy watch lists of known shoplifters valued customers or other persons of interest so they're notified if one of those people shows up and then there's another source of labeled photos those are the ones we've been labeling ourselves by setting up profiles on social media networks it's typically against the terms of use to program BOTS that can download faces and names from sites like LinkedIn Twitter or Facebook but it's doable and what's at stake is something that most of us take for granted our ability to move through public spaces anonymously so we typically think of public and private as being opposites but is there such thing as having privacy when we're in public eye I would like to think so Evan Sellinger is a professor of philosophy who argues that facial recognition is a threat to obscurity which is the idea that personal information is safer when it's hard to obtain or understand so we have natural sort of limitations in what we can perceive and what we can hear even the human mind has you know sort of basic limits and how much information it can store so one of the things that technologies do is they reduce the transaction costs of being able to find information being able to store information being able to share information and being able to correctly interpret information and so the facial recognition is probably the most obscurity of Visser rating technology ever invented we don't have to imagine how this could play out it's already happening with photos from the Russian social media network VK Eric Toller a journalist who covers Europe for Belling cat showed me how it works with a random video of Russian soccer fans picking fights in Poland there's about ten or so of these soccer hooligans in this video and for like every single one of them find their their profiles on weekend here's the first result this guy so you click the photo here it'll take you directly to the photos like here is he's wearing I think he's wearing the same shirt yeah I can write the same charity but this is him too so this is probably like his buddy who uploaded a photo yeah so this is probably this guy's profile here's his buddy right here yes oh here he is during a baptism probably and the photo you uploaded is not like particularly clear or high-resolution oh no not at all right it's just like it's probably 200 by 100 so it is kind of it does feel weird when you do this you have access to more information but you should is what it feels like but also we only public over like 1000 sure of and if possibly double you mean maybe don't include the names of people how you feel about this technology probably depends on how much you sympathize with the person being identified belen cat has used these tools to identify people linked to the attack on flight mh17 in eastern ukraine they've also been used to Doc's police officers accused of brutality anti-corruption activist protesting against Vladimir Putin random strangers as part of an art and sex workers porn performers and others who have posted anonymous photos online the way that we share our images and our names on social media LinkedIn Twitter Instagram it seems to suggest that we don't want to be obscure we're not really looking to be anonymous are we allowed to want to share and connect with other people online and still be able to expect not to be recognized when we're offline in our regular lives I would say absolutely if we ever create a society where that's not a reasonable expectation a lot of the things that are fundamental to being a human being are really going to be compromised having any individuality requires experimenting in life and experimenting requires the protections of some obscurity but also intimacy requires obscurity right if you want to be able to share different parts of your life with different people I think most of us do right we don't want to come into work and behave the same way we do with our friends we don't want to treat our partners in the same way we do acquaintances and the concern when you lose too much obscurity is that these domains bleed into one another and create what's called context collapse and it doesn't mean that one is more real or one is more authentic leading a rich life requires us to be able to express ourselves in these diverse ways the photos we took to share with friends or document history or simply get a government ID have been used to build and operate a technology that strips away the protections that obscurity has always provided us it's nothing less than a massive bait and switch one that could change the meaning of the human face forever hi I'm Joss hey I'm Samantha and we are excited to announce the launch of a new project called open sourced from recode by box for the next year we're going to be writing articles and making videos about the hitting consequences of technology to help you make informed decisions and we would love for you to contribute to our reporting by joining the open-source reporting network we want to know what questions you have about the technology that you use day what do you want to know about how your data is being used please go to voxcom slash open-sourced network to submit your questions and ideas can't wait to hear what you're curious about
