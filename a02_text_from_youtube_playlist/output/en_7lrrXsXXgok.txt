three two [Music] thus begins my quest to build the perfect marshmallow launching machine this is a catapult model it would be extremely dangerous if you were this tall or like a angry squirrel and this model is inspired by the drawings of this genius leonardo da vinci the same guy who painted the super famous mona lisa it's overrated but still pretty good a catapult launches something in the air using power from tension or gravity instead of using gunpowder there are different types this one's called a man janelle it's what you usually think of there's also a ballista think of a crossbow and a trebuchet this part is super heavy in the cow i mean the stone you sorrow goes here then the stone gets released and the heavy stuff helps shoot the stone up and out like a big slingshot catapults were invented in china and europe around the 4th century bc and it was actually a breakthrough they could launch big heavy stones at walls and enemies you could break through a wall with it did i mention we have cicadas here can you hear the cicadas [Music] in the 1300s people said catapults were even used to launch dead bodies over walls because people wanted to spread the plague to their enemies on the corpses but leonardo's catapult it was as elegant as one of his paintings now the first thing is to assemble the drum let's go ahead and do that today leonardo has a reputation for inventing things but when we look back a lot of his inventions were just improvements on things that already existed like this drawing of a ladder to scale castle walls he even made a few things that just didn't work this helicopter looks awesome but it probably wouldn't fly his catapults weren't some totally new thing he took tried and true elements from other catapults and made the design his own our catapult is actually a mashup of these two drawings leonardo made let's switch to something that makes it easier to see what leonardo was thinking that's better okay so the drum and ratchet are going to be how we wind up the catapult they're kind of like the charger to the battery that gives us all the power for this one you turned the handle here to wind up the drop that winds up and pulls the rope which pulls back the wood pieces here now they hold a lot of energy that you use winding up the drum and that is pretty much how this catapult works too see how when i wind the catapult the drum turns and pulls back these rods all that tension lets it launch a payload in our case it's a marshmallow in leonardo's it would have been a large stone or some other projectile that could just bash into castle walls in leonardo's you probably whacked this thing here with a hammer to set the gear loose and fire in ours you lock it by hooking this bar right here to this gear it stops it in place that's taken from leonardo's second design you wound the gear by sticking a bar in one of these holes and pulling everything more taut over and over again then see the bar that locks to a gear it holds the gear in place that is what ours does too when we pull the release rope the bar comes loose the drum unwinds and the catapult fires it's pretty easy a good catapult can hold that tension for as long as it has to it requires all those elements to work in tandem and the person firing it to have the right touch which i do if one thing goes wrong like right here where the bar is out of place the energy is lost and after a few tries i believe that i will be able to make this catapult do something amazing to fire the perfect marshmallow this is a crossbow leonardo designed see that dude there that's how big this thing was and here's leonardo's trebuchet and his ideas for sweet shields to protect soldiers he was a genius he drew a baby in the womb and imagined a parachute and made a crazy accurate overhead map but he was also a guy doodling in a bunch of different notebooks his catapult was probably never used in war but his designs mashed together some really clever ideas people are still tinkering with the design of catapults this is being launched off a carrier by a kind of catapult and from looking at them we can still be inspired to create a replica and i'm no leonardo but that's something that we can do too we can adapt stuff i'm going to attach this to the ground and make the release rope a little longer so that i can launch it myself and get that sweet marshmallow arcing in the air that is something that we can all do we can't all draw or instantly understand physics or get people to build weapons but we can all imagine something amazing three two one [Music] so [Music] ugh you're 22 years old get it together three two one
