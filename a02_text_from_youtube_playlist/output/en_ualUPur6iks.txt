on April 8th 2020 a few hundred people in Florida broke the state's stay-at-home order to go wait in this line hundreds of thousands of people had lost their jobs and applied for unemployment benefits through Florida's online system but the people in this line had come out to get these paper applications because for thousands in Florida the website wasn't working problems from almost the moment it went online site crashes and glitches a process to file is nearly impossible Americans have lost their jobs all over the country but the kind of help they can get depends on what state they live in that's because the US doesn't really have one unemployment system it has 53 of them each state and territory has their own and the differences between them are huge in places like New Jersey and Massachusetts before the economy crashed a little more than half of all workers without jobs were able to collect unemployment benefits in Florida less than 10 percent of unemployed people who are getting them in places like Florida the complicated hard to use unemployment system isn't a mistake it's doing exactly what it was designed to do I haven't really had an answer from anyone oh man look or they may is going by and June 1st is gonna come and I have no idea what I'm gonna do back during the Great Recession lots of people were out of work state unemployment systems were in overdrive in many states the funds that fed those systems were running out of cash so lots of states including Florida raise taxes on businesses that made a lot of business owners unhappy in the 2010 and 2012 elections several states elected Republican governors who promised to reverse those tax hikes any tax increase kills jobs in 2011 when rick scott took office florida employers paid three hundred $19 per worker and unemployment taxes by 2019 when he left they were paying $50 per worker the lowest rate in the country but that meant florida system was underfunded again so the new governor and the Republican legislature started finding ways to pay less money to fewer people they cut weekly payments and reduced the number of weeks that you could collect unemployment if you were laid off but they also redesigned the system itself in 2011 Florida Governor Rick Scott signed a law that moved the state's entire unemployment application process online the new system was notoriously difficult to use no money and no answers because of problems with the state's new 63 million dollar unemployment website in 2019 Florida state auditor released a report on the state's unemployment system it noted that it frequently gave incorrect error messages and would often prevent the submission of an application entirely honestly I'm an unemployment insurance expert and some of the screenshots I've been seeing don't make any sense to me I talked to Michelle evermore an unemployment lawyer and researcher it's clear that there's a very intentional movement to make benefits difficult to access just by making the computer system difficult first Florida's unemployment application itself is extremely difficult to complete think about the last form you filled out online you probably started at the top with basic identifying information then fill in more boxes as you scroll down but to submit a claim on Florida's unemployment website you submit just a few bits of information at a time then click to a new page and hope it's all being saved each time you hit submit in a new page has to load that's a new opportunity for the system to crash and kick you out the website kept kicking you off while you were trying to fill all these questions you will just throw you to the beginning of the website which basically made you start all over again thank you four times here we are 40 something days in I basically today started from square one all over next if you do get through the process it is not active and when you click on that nothing happens you just get this screen of indecipherable stuff and you have to try and figure out what it means absolutely it was designed to fail some Florida politicians have blamed the systems problems on Deloitte the contractor the state used to help build the new online system back in 2013 but that same year Deloitte also helped Massachusetts build its online system using the same basic framework Massachusetts has been able to get benefits to a much greater percentage of jobless people than Florida everybody's trying to blame the computer but in reality it's the politics it's not the computers fault the computer does what you tell it to do in response to the pandemic Congress gave States more than a billion dollars to boost unemployment benefits and made gig workers and freelancers eligible for them but all workers still have to go through state systems like Florida's to get those benefits at some point in their working lives four out of five Americans will need to access safety net programs like unemployment insurance but these programs benefit that one out of five - it keeps money churning in the economy when there's a downturn for every dollar spent in unemployment insurance benefits a dollar 61 was generated in local economic activity it's increasingly clear that our physical health is linked to that of our neighbors it turns out our economic health is too [Music]
