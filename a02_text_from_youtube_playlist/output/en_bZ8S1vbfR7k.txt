i can hear the crowd i can hear my competitors running i can hear the track spikes i feel my heartbeat and i'll never forget i'm running and i'm smiling it was my moment in time kevin young the gold medalist a new world record tom you've held this world record for 29 years 28 years and 11 months kevin young is a former olympic hurdler and up until the night before this interview he held the world record for the 400 meter hurdles event carson warhol bested him by .08 seconds during the tokyo olympic trials and a few days before that sydney mclaughlin broke the woman's world record for the 400 meter hurdles it's an event that's over in under a minute and olympic athletes make it look effortless but it's not as simple as running and jumping it's actually one of the most demanding races on the track [Music] so you got to deal with the endurance factor the the speed factor it's a quarter mile so it's a fast race the cross between sprinting and hurdling puts these athletes in a unique position they need to train to run at the speed of a race half the length and build the endurance needed for a race at least twice the length around the track are 10 hurdles evenly spaced 35 meters apart to get over them hurdlers have to make the most of the three energy systems in the human body typically for the first two hurdles off the blocks the goal is to fire up to race speed the first eight to twelve seconds of a race athletes tap into energy reserves in their muscles which is fine for short explosive races like the hundred meter dash during war homes race you can hear the announcer say he reacted to that gun like a 100 meter sprinter but after about 10 seconds that energy system is spent and there's still at least another 300 meters and plenty of hurdles to go for the next three to five hurdles athletes have to focus on maintaining their speed using the two other energy systems one needs oxygen to help them with endurance as they move through the race the other produces energy fast without oxygen but leads to that familiar muscle burn if they move too fast they'll burn out and have trouble clearing hurdles later on by hurdles six through eight they're coming around that final bend and they need to give it their all to not lose speed this is where you see kevin young surge ahead in the 1992 barcelona olympics kevin young has the lead i got to the eighth hurdle i literally took off away from the field my stride was open i was moving and i just pulled away from everybody at this point legs start to feel heavier and those hurdles start to look higher when talking about hurdles 9 and 10 one track coach i spoke with said it's sheer willpower from that last hurdle there's still another 40 meters to the finish line to sprint but mastering endurance and speed means nothing if you're not clearing the hurdles efficiently and this is what really sets the 400 meter hurdles apart the race isn't just physically taxing it's highly technical it's all about being on the track running that's when you get your speed from the hurdles do to slow you down hurdlers don't jump per se they sort of sprint right over the hurdles the goal is to spend as little time in the air as possible the first leg over the hurdle called the lead lake should already be pushing down to the ground as the trail lake follows over the hurdle once they hit the ground they're focused on the next turtle you have to establish a particular rhythm in the race when athletes like young talk about rhythm they're talking about how many steps they take between each hurdle i remember when i started running the hurdles i would run up on the hurdle trying to go 13 steps between the hurdles because the master edwin moses did it i would always chop steps which is why stride patterns are carefully calculated and practiced long before the starting gun like in young's 1992 world record breaking race stick with your stride pattern the stride pattern was 20 to the first 13 to 2 13 to 3 12 12 for four hurdles four and five then back to 13 for her to six through 10 and 18 steps from the 10th hurdle to the finish line rhythm matters for two reasons one so you don't stutter coming up to a hurdle or clip it like young did on the tenth hurdle of his 1992 race and two so you can control which leg is the lead leg so if you're going 13 steps you're on one consistent leg your dominant leg you're going 14 steps you're going left right left right left right top athletes can lead with either leg but it's not uncommon for them to have a favorite if you have a leg that you don't you're not used to hurling with you may take it and it'll twist you all up and have you off balance and you'll just be hoping and praying that you'd laying on the other side of the hurdle finding and perfecting the right pattern is what drives the best athletes forward but it's not a one-size-fits-all approach just as kevin young couldn't break the world record following the techniques of edwin moses carson warhol couldn't use kevin young's methods he went out harder than i would ever run when 13 to 9 in the 10th hurdle he went 15 and he just went over and it was just speed speed at the end of a well-practiced well-executed plan i know how how well i ran and my success in the sport itself i said these guys are going to take it to a whole level [Music] you
