there's this website livinginthepass.com it's been run by this guy philip lord since the 90s it's this kind of amazing time capsule of what the internet used to be a bunch of html web pages connected with hyperlinks pixelated clip art the papyrus font it's a chronicle of one man's passion projects lord's model building endeavors deep dives into his family history and someone named henry rogers an artist known for impressionist-style paris street scenes who lord became obsessed with tracking down because when you look closer at henry rogers paintings things don't really add up the signatures for example sometimes henry sometimes the french henri and when you try to search for henry rogers online there's no information about the painter himself it's almost like he only exists in these paintings of paris the more i read lord's website the more i wanted to know who really made these paintings it's a puzzle that led me from the paris street art scene to an ai art center in cleveland and to drop 300 on ebay all to try and answer the question who is henry rogers [Music] henry rogers paintings are pretty easy to come by online and it doesn't take long to become familiar with the core elements of his paintings there's usually this blue roofed building next to this reddish one both with cloth awnings and across the street another blue roofed building next to another reddish one sometimes this street leads to a paris landmark like the eiffel tower sometimes it doesn't you'll always see a tree or a row of trees and along the wet rainy looking street faceless blobs of people who all seem to be walking away from the viewer they're almost entirely done with a painting knife rather than a brush this technique adds texture to paintings and can result in little detail it's a style that calls back to french impressionism an art movement that was popular in europe in the late 1800s with the most famous artists working in paris at this point you might be thinking okay so this is kind of like a parisian bob ross someone who developed a technique to mix and match elements quickly like the classic rogers tree and managed to produce a large number of similar looking paintings over their lifetime that could be true but before we throw out any theories let's lay out everything we know about henry rogers and let's start online living in the past.com is still the only place on the internet that's devoted any research into these paintings philip lord told me that the obsession had faded for him and he didn't want to give an interview but he gave me permission to use his website as a starting point for my own investigation lord's search for the elusive french artist began with this painting which hung on the wall of his childhood home in upstate new york but when he tried to find info about the artist who signed it nothing turned up lord had a bunch of theories for who rogers might be but generally they fall into three potential buckets one henry rogers was a very busy french painter working in paris sometime in the 70s and 80s who spelled his name two ways two henry rogers was a group of artists making these paintings together and using a pseudonym to make them seem more valuable and on the more extreme end three henry rogers paintings were mass-produced likely by so-called factories in china where artists methodically create similar looking paintings to figure out if rogers was one person lord started meticulously dissecting images of henry rogers paintings he found online ones that turned up in san diego and toronto but also in germany and one in south africa several of the frames were stamped made in mexico on the back like three of the ones i bought he compared signatures between henry and henry searched google street view to find where a painter might have stood and diagrams the shifting perspectives of the classic rogers street determining that its basic layout looks like this he also looked into similar artists like caroline burnette another prolific painter with a similar style and similarly murky origins when he considered the close resemblance of the knife techniques for henry and henry and that the paintings very often seem to depict the same street from various positions he landed here in his opinion henry rogers was one artist working in the streets of paris sometime in the 1970s and 1980s who may have exported his work for sale in foreign markets which helps explain the wide distribution and the mexican frames but philip lord never really had a smoking gun and he gave up trying to find more about henry rogers in 2011. so when i picked up the case in 2022 i wanted to start with a fresh source one that philip hadn't tried a paris street painter let me show you some paintings really quick yeah they're good but it looks like they've never been in paris jerome is an artist who works in the part of paris henry rogers would have been working in the historic monmouth district street artists have been painting in montmartre for hundreds of years many of them sell their work off in scenes of paris or portraits to tourists jerome works nightly in the most famous hub in montmartre for painters it's a square called place duterte he told me it's not uncommon for people to sell or exhibit paintings in paris they claim were made in place duterte but weren't he said they'll even often be signed with a fake french name like dupont durong and there's no dupont duran plus duterte but it looks like exotic when i asked him about the streets themselves and the angles philip lord had painstakingly diagrammed okay look this is the same country street i have never in paris you can see this kind of angle but they put the effect out to do like a nice background it's like a fantasy jerome thinks the made in mexico stamp on the frames the imagined perspectives and the varying signatures point to henry rogers being a mexican artist or group of artists selling these paintings as cheap decor items made to look like a souvenir from place to tear it looks like the taste of paris like the authentic way the romantic way at this point i felt like there had to be something philip and i were both missing and that jerome couldn't see over skype some clue too tiny to notice by just looking at the paintings alone or that needed to be seen up close by an expert that's when i reached out to case western reserve university in cleveland a group of scientists and art history experts there are using artificial intelligence to help tell artists apart based on microscopic differences in brush stroke style they invited me to their lab in cleveland to see if they could tell me anything about my rogers paintings so we're looking for things that are common across the paintings and we're trying to control as many variables as possible anna martin runs case western's more center that's the materials for opto electronics research and education center so what i'm going to do is measure out pieces of the painting i'm going to do pieces of the sky and then the trees she's scanning common elements of each painting using this machine an optical profilometer this tool could help us figure out if certain elements of these paintings were done by different hands basically it shoots this little dot of light onto the surface of the painting and measures the distance the light traveled when it bounces back charting out microscopic changes in height of paint a single data point spans just 11 microns which is apparently very very very small so it's the fraction of a width of a human hair they called me two weeks later with the results um so we prepared a couple of slides these were the scans that idna took for their experiment the team scanned a bunch of five millimeter patches from three of my paintings and created a detailed height map they used this data to assign each painting a profile one two and three then they fed different unknown five millimeter sections of all three paintings through the machine to see if it could identify which painting the sections came from basically if it could connect a patch like this to an entire painting and if it can do that that's a clue that perhaps there are different hands involved if it's the same person and we tested this in the past the machine basically fails at that task because he can't distinguish the patches and roughly 90 percent of the time the computer got it right there were enough differences in technique at a microscopic height level to accurately identify which painting was which the fact that these paintings have their own unique fingerprint is a strong case for henry rogers being the name of a workshop some group of artists who were trained to imitate each other almost perfectly with nearly invisible differences between the paintings i let the team at case western keep my henry rogers paintings for further study this has also helped us in thinking about how we're going to approach other paintings etc so this has actually been a very useful kind of exercise hopefully it'll help get the machine closer to identifying invisible fingerprints in other more famous paintings and now like philip lord before me i'm closing up the case but with a lot of new information and having gotten just a bit closer to finding out who henry rogers was and henry if you're out there i love the work email me if you see this [Music] do [Music]
