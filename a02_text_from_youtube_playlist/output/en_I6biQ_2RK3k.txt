on March 28 2020 the governor of New York announced that he was delaying his state's April election I don't think it's wise he'd be bringing a lot of people to one location 18 other states had already delayed or modified their spring elections it would endanger public health to allow thousands of people to assemble but the state of Wisconsin made a different call the only state to move ahead with its election polls if you can believe it are open in Wisconsin this morning on April 7th voters in Wisconsin got in line waited for hours standing six feet apart wearing mass with some poll workers in full protective gear one voter made a sign that seemed to sum up the situation perfectly people are calling it the photo of the year quote this is ridiculous I'm sitting with my card in my lap I was like this whole thing is just ridiculous the people who are supposed to be making sure things are safe for us like I felt like they kind of threw us under the wagon you know the next day the Governor of New Jersey announced they were postponing their election to I don't want a Wisconsin where folks had to pick between exercising their right to vote on the one hand and protecting their own personal health Wisconsin's election highlights something that the u.s.
really needs to figure out soon in November there's an election to decide the next president but it's highly unlikely that Kovan 19 will be over and done with by them we might even be dealing with a second wave of it so if public gatherings are a health risk how are you supposed to have an election I am coming to you from the Robert's family voting booth here my dining room table this is Dave he's at home in Seattle Washington Dave's done a lot of reporting on what he says is a simple solution to how America can vote during the pandemic every election and it's fun Washington is one of the few states that runs its entire election through the mail I think I've been voting voting by mail basically works by taking two important elements of Odie's verifying your identity and filling out the ballot and moving them from a polling place to your home where the ballot gets mailed a few weeks before the election and that has two really obvious benefits first you have literally weeks to do as much research as you want so when you fill that circle you're like I'm friggin voting I'm capital D voting right now and second voting by mail takes away a lot of the common reasons people don't vote being forced to take a day off work fine I want to watch the kids you take your kids with you and go to a crowded balloting place hope that your name hasn't been struck from some role for some random reason wait four hours three hours five hours inline voting by mail clears those hurdles and the effects are really easy to see in 2018 a County in western Nebraska got permission from the state to run their entire election by mail every voter there got a mail-in ballot while voters in the rest of the state voted the old-fashioned way across Nebraska voter turnout was 24% but in that one County it was important double that turns out that making it easier to vote means more people vote on average states with all-male voting systems have a higher turnout than other states a poll from April 2020 find that Americans would overwhelmingly be in favor of holding the next presidential election entirely by mail but that still leaves a chunk who aren't sold on it one reason is fraud the possibility that your vote might be more likely to get lost stolen or coerced if you vote at home so I asked an expert on voting by mail how serious and common Orestes is it's exceedingly rare so I also asked someone who runs elections no widespread or systematic voter fraud I asked a political scientist use an expert on election data it's highly unlikely anyone's gonna steal your vote an election law expert concerns about voter fraud or way over Heights and an expert on voting rights you are still more likely to be struck by lightning than to find mail ballot fraud the reason vote by mail fraud is rare is that even though in theory it's possible it's not very effective it helps to think in terms of wholesale fraud versus retail fraud election security experts worry about wholesale fraud lots and lots of votes being tampered with at once people are voting on machine you just have to have the one machine with one point of contact there are a lot less worried about what they call retail fraud votes that get tampered with one at a time that someone could come by and seal your ballot fill it out but even if that does happen vote by mail systems typically give you a way to track your vote and make sure it's been counted you can track you about like an Amazon package does not get much more secure than that you can actually go in our system and track it from when they receive it when they verify the signature and when it's ready to count if they haven't returned that ballot I guarantee you that the voter picks up the phone and causes election officials the checks and balances that are invoked by mail in California there are stronger and stricter guidelines on processing vote by mail than there are in person burgers to me it's a much more secure process the same week that Wisconsin held its election the state of Georgia sent all its voters forms that would let them request a mail ballot but Georgia's Speaker of the House complained he said voting by mail benefits Democrats this will be extremely devastating to two Republicans and service in Georgia but there's no evidence that voting by mail is better for either party a study at Stanford found that it doesn't get either party a bigger share of either turnout or the vote itself all it does is increase the number of people who vote we haven't seen any any benefit to one party over another there's nothing political about voting and and more people voting is a good thing providing that all vote-by-mail experience didn't change those dynamics people were still voting the way they wanted to vote I'm pretty sure I'm living proof that you can elect a Republican in a blue state and you can do it in a vote-by-mail environment every state in the u.s. already has some kind of vote-by-mail option it's called an absentee ballot but some states will only give you one if you have a good excuse like if you're out of town or in the military other states offer a no excuse absentee ballot where you don't need to give a reason but you still have to request it voting by mail is something every state already allows but very few states are actually prepared to do an entire election through the mail that's what caused the problem in Wisconsin in 2016 about 250,000 Wisconsin voters requested an absentee ballot in 2020 about five times that number requested absentee ballots Wisconsin hadn't prepared for that so a lot of people never got their ballots and had to go vote in person instead I was one of over 55,000 people who had requested an absentee ballot who had not yet received it I am desperately hoping that we can make that an exclusive option if we're still dealing with unsafe situations in November it would not be that difficult to ramp that up in time for the election I mean you need to start now it's not trivial but it's very doable in the five states that have all-male voting there's still an option to vote in person a back up mostly for people who didn't get a ballot or weren't registered to vote in time but in most places voting by mail is the back up and if lots of voters feel that voting in person isn't safe a backup won't be good enough preparing election systems for that will take time and right now there is time but only if we start now [Music]
