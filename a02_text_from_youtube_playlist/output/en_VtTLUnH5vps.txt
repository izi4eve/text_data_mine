there's something you might notice when you go out to eat depending on the restaurant you go to the Entre and drinks can vary a lot but then the dessert menu drops and you're almost always left staring down the same options a cheesecake maybe a chocolate lava cake and some type of fruit pie probably a sorbet or ice cream desserts in a lot of restaurants are kind of boring there's a reason why but it doesn't have to be this way menu curation can make or break a restaurant because frankly it's really hard to make money in this business profit margins for restaurants are not particularly High um it's interesting because so many people want to go into the restaurant business because they think it's glamorous or whatever um it's definitely less than 10% Katherine Gordon teaches restaurant and culinary management at The Institute of Culinary educ in New York the revenue is going to come in on the food and the beverage sales and then there's going to be the cost of goods to support those food and beverage sales things like ingredients and staff salaries rent electricity and more what's left it's a low number and then of course it has to be taxed after that the menu is really their one chance to maximize profits but it's a delicate balance charge too much and people won't buy it charge too little and you'll miss out when Priced Right the ENT will bring in the most profit and it's not really a secret that drinks are relatively cheap to make and easy to upcharge both alcoholic and non-alcoholic and people will often pay that multiple times throughout a meal but outside of drinks and Entre it's not so easy to make money look at appetizers for example with an average profit margin all the way down at 22% luckily if you're Savvy there are ways to work appetizers into a menu and recoup the cost so what people try to do is like what we call cross utilization of product for example you can buy a full chicken cheaper than pieces of a chicken and then you might be able to use the chicken bones after it's broken down for your base for your stock and then that stock can become a sauce or it can become a soup and you can sell that and then you can sell like your chicken breast like on a salad or something you know at lunch and then you can have the chicken thighs and a dish at the dinner time and then you might even have like little scrap pieces and I don't know you're selling chicken tacos at the bar something like that you know so it's like full utilization so when done properly the menu fits together like a neat little puzzle but desserts are sometimes hard to fit in making them is one thing but making them well requires an entirely different skill set from the rest of the kitchen plus you want that amazing wow kind of thing at your restaurant you have to dedicate space and not every place has it because the rents for how many square feet you're getting is just astronomical these days and people just can't afford more little physical location there's also ingredients to consider cream cheese and chocolate and nuts and things like that you may not be using them in other parts of your menu desserts are one of the most expensive things to make in terms of ingredients ingredient costs in the world change like consumers see inflation as well it's more than the egg inflation we've all been frustrated with in 2018 the cost of vanilla Skyrocket at DOR crisis in Madagascar it's stabilized but it's never really returned to where it once was bad weather in West Africa where around 70% of the worlds cocoa comes from has led to dramatic increases as well when all is said and done desserts are tied with appetizers as the lowest average profit margins in restaurants and one of the hardest to fit into that neat little menu puzzle so when a restaurant is struggling in-house pastry chefs are often the first to go especially because restaurants can offer desserts at a much lower cost by Outsourcing them into entirely thus the same desserts everywhere you go but there is something about dessert these places are often missing the marketability of the experience okay but before we get into that let's take a

suggests there's a shift in how consumers are viewing Desserts when going out to eat only 11% of Boomers on average order dessert compared to over 30% of Jen Z or Millennial diners at bad Roman an Italian restaurant in Manhattan that number is much higher it's close to 40% of our our guests are ordering desserts Chef Craig koketsu and pastry chef Lucy blanch helped create the restaurant's dessert menu and part of the reason so many people are ordering from it is because they've tapped into the importance of marketability you know the saying is that people eat with their eyes first and it's totally true you know so you want to capture them first visually Chef Lucy's viral lemon cheesecake really captured people I mean it's a lemon cheesecake beautifully molded to be shaped like lemons served on a lemon plate it's even fun to eat since you're encouraged to crack the shell before diving in and of course it tastes amazing it's very important to me that things look wonderful but more than anything also that they taste amazing I remember one of the uh team members that were at the table when we brought the dish out saying well this is a home run and he was right at the end of the day the only way for a restaurant to really make money is to get people into seats viral hits like this can drive customers into a restaurant and more customers can obviously turn more of a profit as they spend on Entre and drinks but in order to get diners coming back again and again chefs can't rely on one dish the entire menu has to work together and desserts have a unique opportunity it's the last thing that the diner you know uh sort of like identifies with on the table everything will be memorable but I feel like the last thing that they eat it's always like that what's going to make it you know what's going to make your entire meal dining out has always been about more than what you eat and so that's how dessert can fit into this menu puzzle as the final cherry on top of the experience that makes you want to come back and send your friends and spend a little extra at the end [Music]
