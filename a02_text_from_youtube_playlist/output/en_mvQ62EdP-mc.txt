[Music] i used to think that i wasn't competitive eugene it already looked good and it was such a simple concept got the phone call thought it was mad time under the mountain scrambles it's one of his trademarks to the front oh he's caught and he's calling like they pulled these doors open you've got 20 seconds let's go and that's the only reason i'm competing why are you competing to come second you're not you're competing to come first right you want to win it comes richard thompson this is this is wild how do i even get my head around this and like there's this massive warehouse that we never knew was there [Music] we used to do a lot of tag someone had a like a gopro and um we just thought let's um test the gopro and film one of our games of tags and um so we put the helmet on and then we just started playing tag in the garden and it just kind of shows how how the sport has sort of evolved right [Music] can you explain to me the basic rules of a chase tag match basically there's two teams of up to five or six athletes depending on the tournament [Music] [Applause] each chase lasts 20 seconds [Music] one person is a chaser and one person is an invader and the chase has to try and tag the vader and the evader has to try and not get caught and whoever wins stays on as the evader that's the most important thing um so the winner always stays on his evader and um if the veda can last 20 seconds without getting caught then they get a point and each match is basically the best of 16 chases one of the things that i noticed as a viewer is the sort of array of names that different obstacles have [Music] we do we do a clockwise we do a clockwise overview of all the obstacles so you've got the front line people can just jump straight from a chase plate over the front line which is like a six foot jump about three foot up um it's quite impressive come across the sisters which are two boards you can take off of the first one and jump the second one or you can do a double kong or a dive kong which is when you like slap with your hands and your bum comes up in the air [Music] after the sisters you get to the back line and this first obstacle in the back left is where a lot of the evaders will start it's called the tilted cube again the tilted cube providing a lot of protection is also one of the highest places for people to get tagged come around the back line which puts you underneath the mountain which is this big structure at the back with two big boards and a big flat board at the front all the way at the back we've got the loading bay this is the back right you're gonna hit the ridge which is a really high wall it's probably the the most likely obstacle to clip your knees on [Music] do you have a breakdown of what makes a really good or bad chase i think the definition of a good chase is the number of of interesting interactions probably chasers have a certain kind of dynamic we kind of look at them as like interactions and then it chases so the first four seconds of a chase is just the chaser getting towards evader then there's an interaction and then and then there's interaction either he gets caught or he moves on to another part of the court and then there's another interaction so there is a kind of dynamic to a chase there's a kind of interactions then a pursuit interaction pursuit interaction pursuit you know we have a term called eq which is like evasion quality and that's like probably the most important thing to remember to do with the courts so if it's a low eq area there's not much protection if it's a high e key area there's a lot of protection and then we realize the more obstacles we sort of put in the court we realize it got more interesting the more obstacles there were then we realized actually parkour people are probably going to be the best athletes to play because there's so many obstacles [Music] what is going on in this clip i'm coming up super high so i can reach above the bar not just grab it with my fingertips i'm actually grabbing it with bent arms then i can load all the weight onto my lats transfer underneath the bar with a swing up to the other side of the bath of a 180 grab the bar again so i've also had to let go of it to do 180 and then once i've grabbed i'm re-engaging all of my like active shoulder movement so lats a lot of shoulders like pulling in and then being able to spot where i'm going and throw my hips up above the space that i'm gonna land on and then land on the balls of my feet which is like a must with parkour because if you land anywhere on the box you could slip if you land on the edge you've actually got something to push against and it needs to be the balls of your feet because if you land on your toes you'll slip and if you land in the middle it will hurt and if you land on the heels you could slip so it has to be this is part of your foot that's strong you're reminding me of in those guy richie sherlock holmes movies when holmes gets in some sort of situation count with crossed left cheek the whole point of parkour like the philosophy behind it is basically like self-control and understanding of your body and understanding of your surroundings and stuff like that how is the parkour world organized into these teams what are teams so all these brands came about as yeah just groups of young lads who were training together often having fun and wanting to try and make a living off of it that first time that you tried world chase tech do you remember how that felt or what you thought yeah i was really tired he's coming underneath the sisters was that attack no britain's still in pursuit he's managed to go underneath for ridge bridge it was like this is really tiring um but as a parkour athlete you're used to doing like lines that are like really really short and explosive right and you have a preset route like you don't just run around as people think like on grooves and like do anything you don't do that everything's pretty thought out everything's tested everything's like i know what i can do with this it's like ah it's totally like instinctual at first because obviously when you first play you don't think about tactics you're just like okay just run like you know and obviously like you play the first game you're like oh okay there's the first two three games you're like okay there's some strategy to this you're familiar with in like um any ball sport you get juking so you'd go like you're going up to a player and you divert so it looks like you're going to go go one way and you go the other way that's like a really obvious like we use duking idling is a great time but it's when you you've got an obstacle between you and another person so there's an impasse and you look like you're moving but you're not so you're just you're on the balls of your feet you're almost it's like an engine is running and then it it explodes and that's it's the build up it's a crescendo before the like great drop in the music wait to see look at that yeah giving them a little bit of hands oh but there's proper mental torture almost of like antagonizing somebody and getting them frustrated so you know what they're gonna do you know like telegraphing something is something that's really really important i think that fighting is really really similar mountain this could be a first point eugen oh what can you tell me about this idea of hurting one of the techniques would be called shepherding and i think i'm safe to say that that's quite well known yeah i've i've been using herding you just classed it up like twenty percent yes chef yeah i mean the name says it is sort of like you're doing this you're doing this and you're keeping them in a corner and it's like having control over where they are because you're almost like you're at their mercy if you're following them around religiously whereas if you are shepherding them and keeping them into a corner you have control in that situation upstairs haroon hanafi maroon hurts perfectly now nobody has ever managed to successfully evade haroon in the history of world chase tag reversad is really really tricky to do um and it's basically to keep your eyes on the opponent as an evader and run them through high eq obstacles while they're chasing you and i know it's something he's worked on because i've talked to him i'm friends with him and he's uh he basically points steps up goes up to the mountain drops down haroon pointing one way going the other a trademark of his being a chaser used to be easier it's now made a little bit harder because they they talk about eq evasion quality uh quite a lot and they're trying to increase that what they want to do is they want to keep the eq at 25 so i used to love chasing because i thought it was really really easy and i could get it done but for like pure glory evasions are like how you get points right like evasion is how you get a point and how you get it done so i love that the most we always used to play in open garden and then i remember the day the first time the obstacles kind of came into it um christian had cut the hedge and we started to play around the hedge clippings and that was the first time we thought actually that's pretty that's pretty good so it was running based so if you are fast and agile then you would dominate then when we introduced the bench it was quite a low bench you had to go over the bench so it was a different skill yeah we started in the garden then we started a meet-up group once it got to winter people were sliding it was muddy and it was raining so we moved into a gym that called our parkour generations that was um the the first parkour gym that opened up in like in london they had much better obstacles so we started to like do that but they were just boxes and bars we bought some scaffolding and we basically made our own quad and this was the definite watershed moment for us because we knew it was fun this video of you guys this is maybe my favorite footage that i've ever received from a source of you guys debating the placement of the bars in your in your back garden barrack and the good thing about it is that again the eq the staff is gonna be no thing around here you'll help the chaser to stop benny hill if the bar is here within sort of actually foot high see the bar there yeah that's the thing you actually don't want that bar there because it might help them come up here but what the chase would do is that if someone flies through from into this hole and you're there suppose suppose we've had that conversation a million times so we just then had to refine the rules and then we just been refining the quad and then just refining it and finding it as we go along i don't think it's a big priority it's gonna be a hassle to do it uh let's um let's you know i think i i i didn't i'll have to measure up and do it but yeah i could put one there what is your name and what is your primary occupation in the world of sports commentary um dan dawson i've ridiculously accidentally ended up with this sort of moniker of dan darts dawson international darts open the final european tour event of the year has just played out and it's been won by this man the rock star joe cullen and it is a heartbreaker for franz rich andy hamilton with a nine daughter and so you're sort of put in this interesting position because you have all this knowledge about darts in the darts world but then suddenly you have to become obsessed with world chase tag in a very short period of time somebody i'd worked with on the darts um had got in touch just bummed me a speculative email saying i'm i'm doing a doing this thing it's like uh it's it's like a sport but it's like like tag you know like the playground game and then as soon as i i googled it and had a look like i was i was blown away i was aware of parkour but only like when i was a teenager i think when it all sort of started happening there were these impossibly cool french guys going uh parkour it's it's a philosophy it is not a sport it is a way of life and i remember people just running around as a teenager like jumping on walls and stuff a bit like this the american office geezer who just runs around shouting parkour and then to see this turned into an actual competitive sport was was cool but i i was i still wasn't prepared for when i actually got down there on the day he cannot get hold of him i mean look at me i walked into that place and they all looked like greek gods i was like i was like jabba the hutt being surrounded by like three dozen luke skywalkers somersaulting all over the place like that is not my natural habitat but to go in there and just try and learn that speaking to damien and christian about how they came up with the game and the concept connor was invaluable when i was working with him just to try yeah i got him to just walk me around the quad over the sisters around towards his front line looking to cut down the angle and does so crazy play he had to make up for lost time from a small slipper early on he's managed to run chasing down across the front line and get down on top of the other player i'm learning as much as anybody else about this it's a new sport for everybody to get their head around [Music] what makes you the people who are in the rain assembling the scaffolding debating the placement of a bar what what drives this obsession for you i wanted to see the best people chase and i i really hope there's a day where people are you know at the age of eight they get into chase tag and they just train the whole time and i'd love to see them when they're 25 or 28 at the peak of their physical condition training against other people who have also trained since they were eight i will go to sleep at night some nights like when i'm really like preparing for a competition like thinking about roots and lines and things i go like down a rabbit hole you think in your head your your little vision of yourself you go yeah i can do i can do all of that absolutely all of it and then you realize that you can't even carry your washing upstairs without tripping over the cat or something when we do parkour we say we're training like we're training like what are we training for and i suppose you could say it was a situation in which you're chasing or evading someone so it's almost like world chase tag is like the thing that we are preparing ourselves for i start describing how the sport works and as i'm describing it i get like a feedback loop of man this sounds really good i'd love to watch this you just see how similar like we all are regardless of actually where we're from you know and this is this is a really interesting element for me that all humans could be united by this one activity that they all do [Music] that's a giant skull in the background [Music] do you want scholar no skull skulls fine [Music] at the time when lockdown first happened we were sort of tentatively talking about having quite a few events i think we had a european championship sort of penciled in we had a potential event in saudi arabia pennsylvan we also had an america what was going to be the world championships in america and then as soon as lockdown came up we just realized that you know none of that was gonna happen our final decision which is sort of encouraged by the investors that we have at the moment they said okay let's do a u.s national event and that's what we ended up doing in october in atlanta another thing that like that came positive out of the lockdown what happened in the uk was we got really good weather and normally when we have the quad up we only put the quad up for events so we have we book a space we put the quad up and that's the only time me and damon get to see it up and we could never use it because all the athletes want to train on it so during lockdown when we had the good weather we decided to put the quad up it's first time we died and so for us we had more time on the quad than we've ever had before you
