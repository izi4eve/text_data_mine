it's called the the gray area right for a reason right you know I and I'm giving you black and white I love that I mean this is this is this is this is the and this is what we're here for you know I it's it's called that because I think life is messy and complicated and the temptation to blot out complexity for the sake hold on now hold on Professor just the the tendency to out complexity for the sake of a more simple story is understandable but I do think it can become dangerous in its own way and I'm constantly attuned to that threat maybe too attuned actually and I like that this is a reflex you challenge in the book and you're challenging here because it really forced me to think about it as I was reading it and I'm thinking about it now and this isn't a debate show like and it's not a certain CBS Morning Show I don't give a about winning arguments or creating spectacle like I really want to understand what someone is thinking and what I can learn from them so but Sean it is complex it's just not complex in the way they say it is okay so you got to help me understand that there is complex it is extremely complex but just not in what the the way they the complexity that they're selling you is not the complexity see that's what I want to iron out right so like when I was reading it in the book and listening to you when you compare Palestine to the G Crow South right like my reaction while reading that is yeah these are both moral obscenities and but they're different and I do think it's complicated and so tell me about that I would tell me about that why I think it's complicated yeah like why would do you say it's different you know like first of all do you think the Jim Co South was uncomplicated no just complicated in a different way right I mean I can tell you why I think they're different okay go ahead I think it matters that many Palestinians still support the October 7th attacks I think that black people in the Jim Crow South wanted to be treated as equal citizens and fully democra America I think that matters I don't think it's generally true that Palestinians want equal rights in a fully Democratic Israel and if they had that they might vote to end its existence as a Jewish State and you know what if I was a Palestinian who was pulling my friends and my family out of the Rubble I'd probably vote the same way I mean personally I hate the idea of a state based entirely in religious or ethnic identity but I'm not Jewish and I don't live in Israel and I understand why this is a problem for them right and I also think it matters that Jews are also indigenous to that land have nowhere else to go I just think that complicates the picture in other ways that's my feelings now you can go ahead and so I'm I am of the mind and everybody does not have to agree with this but I just want to clarify the the the a real distinction and then I want to go through the the example you gave because I actually I think it's actually quite helpful yeah I am of the mind that discrimination on the basis of race ethnicity religion is never acceptable there is nothing in this world that will make separate and unequal and as far as I am concerned I will use this word and we can debate this word if we need to there is nothing that makes a part tile nothing that's not complex for me it's like the death penalty is not really complex for me yeah because you cannot guarantee to me that the state will not execute an innocent person you just can't can't age I mean I might not be for it even if you could but among other reasons like so I'm a against it period like there aren't exceptions to that it's hard as an africanamerican for me to argue for exceptions for aarti and I will tell you why see the thing you have to do is not judge Jim mro from right now or I would argue slavery from right now you have to put yourself in the shoes of the people that were there in the debates at the time and I assure you they did not think it was simple and I like this reasoning about complexity is actually you talk to Thomas Jefferson right he would have said did say you know what I think this is a moral Abomination but we have the wolf by the ear that's how he described the practice of holding people and selling them for profit into slavery what did he mean by we have the wolf by the ear he means we need to let it go but we dare not he's trying to get to in his mind the complexity of enslavement if not for the Civil War I I like if not for like like a cataclysmic War that kills what 800,000 Americans or certainly there's no stroke of to pin abolition why because they describe what are we going to do with them where they going to go you know I mean all of these you know sort of issues in addition to this in addition what they would say is democracy is fit for a certain class of people this is what they believed at the time so you have to take it seriously even if it sounds ridiculous to you right now democracy is fit for a certain class of people these people have not been educated there are just a few Generations out of the Ws of Africa where they worship some Savage God and they Bailey Chris like this these this is the logic if you moved into the 20th century getting closer to our lifetimes people would have said what about crime crime in these people's neighborhoods they would have cited the statistics and they would have been real they would have been real they said crime in these you know black quars these start is ridiculous if we integrate we will inherit that we will now have to deal with that so like to them segregation was also complicated I think in those instances like you have to just like this becomes right or and wrong yeah you know like I think was crime not higher in Black yeah it was yeah it was can I guarantee that they free all enslaved people and they try to you know move into America actually went remarkably smooth so that's not a good example you know what I mean I mean it turned out that those arguments were covered for something else as they might be here by the way yeah um but what I'm saying is in that time it is not as if people were like this is simple and clear they were not I have to ask myself do I believe that a demographic project which is what Israel is and what they say out loud does that goal Accord with my humanistic values do I want my country supporting that and I don't think I do because the moment you say that you must discriminate you you have to yeah there is no world in which you have a Jewish democracy you have a Jewish state yeah but you just and that and again I always had to be careful about this it's not the jewishness of it you understand like I would I believe this about ethnicity period across the board I haven't been to Palestine oh man you but I know it's bad and I know what you saw there is wrong and I don't believe there is any such thing as a moral occupation because whatever the reasons for it you cannot occupy a people without visiting cruelties upon them just full stop right for me the first question I go to the main question is is is it necessarily the Badness of the situation which is incontestable and egregious and obvious it's how the hell do we stop it right and for me all these complications that I was mentioning earlier that's the stuff that has to be accounted for if there's any hope of a way forward but you're not here to profer some two-state solution or but I am here for a solution I have a solution for you and it goes back to that interview on CBS you there is no I mean I I don't actually have a solution but I do I do we are sitting here asking ourselves why we don't have a workable solution while we exclude one of the two significant parties and I guess my politic would say the most significant party because that's just where I come from in term terms of the o press from the conversation how can you decide what is going to be the solution when every night when I cut on TV and I watch watch reports from the region I can name only one person who of Palestinian Heritage who who I regularly see articulate you know a solution or an idea how do we get to a solution when our our journals our newspapers our literature that dominates the con conversation is not just devoid of Palestinian perspectives but it's the void of Palestinians themselves we are not having a conversation about Solutions because we've basically prevented a whole group of people from entering into the frame and so it's like we're kind of putting a cart before the whole we're frustrated that we don't have a solute but but like we're not actually talking to somebody you know what I mean it's like you know you you go into the sorry I cook so I have all of these like cooking metaphors no I love it okay so you go in and and and you do your mac and cheese and you know it turns out terrible and you're like why did this turn out ter well do you have a recipe like do you actually did you take the time to come up with you know what I mean the ingredients did you talk to anybody like or did you just go in and you know throw pasta and milk and you know what I mean and you know do you know anything about a Ru do you know anything about that you know what I mean do you know anything about like what cheese melt and with that like have you had these conversations this is on us by the way this is journalism's great sin and this is how and I'm going to say something like you I I called I'm about to say the extremist thing is I I called it CBS right this is our contribution to a part time because we are the agents by which people are dehumanized you know and I want to make that very very specific when you exclude people from the conversation when they don't have a role in your in your journalism when they don't have a role in your film when they don't have a role in your TV when they don't have a role in your books they cease to exist as people and become these kind of cartoon cutouts that other people make of them and they become much more easy to kill that's on us it's extreme but I believe it I don't know man I I I do I think our moral imagination needs to extend in both directions as far as possible but I The more I've listened to you and as I made my way through your book I think I understand where you're coming from I I I understand writing this as a kind of corrective feeling like there was a lack of empathy for the Palestinian experience because their story hasn't been told enough hasn't been represented enough I can understand that I I really can and if I'm being honest I mean I I think if I went there like you and saw the suffering firsthand all of this would feel a whole lot less abstract to me and it would hit differently and I don't know how that would change how I so so when are you going to go Sean I don't know you should go I don't know I know it's hard and I look I just I'm I'm putting you on the spot but it was extremely hard for I'm going to fail this class aren't I no no you're not no no no here's look look look first of all you you are a journalist that's the first thing okay that that's my first case toward you for going the second case is this is being done in your name man and we're going to P for it we're going to pay for it one one way or the other we will pay for this we will pay for this I God I'm now I think it's your responsibility to go I'm sorry I really do believe that I really really do believe that because um you are someone who is obviously curious you obviously want to you know know things and the reason why I'm pushing you is because that kind of uh vague sense of Injustice is exactly what I had that is exactly how I felt man but can I push you a little bit on that here's the thing I have no doubt about that but if I went to Israel and toward the villages that were plundered on October 7th I'd feel the same kind of indignation and rage you should though so what do you do with that but I don't think those are contrary no I don't mean to say they're contrary I'm just saying I would still be left feeling the sense of hopelessness really at the the the tragedy of it all and the fact that it just seems to be I think you would know more though I think I think you would know more no doubt about that and I think you can't judge how you would feel until you go um and you know what one of the reasons I I haven't opined on this issue very much is that I feel like I don't know what the hell I'm talking about that's why you that's why you go and I don't want to be one of those who opine on things great but it doesn't it doesn't you know uh obate the responsibility for going that's why you go that that's why you go man and um I I don't know I mean I I I think you should not now I'm being Professor again like you just don't know until you go through it you don't you don't know what's what's going to happen I I I do want to speak to your instinct though that a horror at the desecration and destruction of of human life on October 7th is somehow contrary or somehow stands even in Conflict I would argue with the opposition to a part tide and I I've thought about this quite a bit right there is a long record of people who have causes that I would find sympathetic erupting in a kind of violence that I recoil from okay I'm going to speak as I I'll just speak from the perspective of an African-American and African-American history um and all my black people are about to cast me out for what I'm about to say um but I but I think it's a good example 1830s um Nat Turner is enslaved in Virginia has no rights over his body has no rights over his his family have no rights over over their body anything can be done to him at any moment he has no control over himself and decides in that situation he's he's locked out of the political system can't vote his way out can't do anything decides at that moment that the way out is violence and the way out is not just violence the way out is Massacre that is to say not a a violent rebellion in which we strategically Target things for instance like John Brown targets the Arsenal at Harper Ferry but actual Slaughter okay that means every slave master every slave mistress every child must die gathers together his army and and and and they kill everybody they come across they hack infants in in in in the in the crib kill women men Etc I you know I was raised with Nat Turner as a hero of of resistance and it's understandable why Nat Turner would be a hero of resistance but the older you get you know especially if you're going to write right like you're going to write you know what I'm saying like not if you're just going to you know sort of construct a mythology that all people construct but if you're going to write you're going to interrogate your own stories you take a deeper look at that he say does the complete degradation of my life make it right for me to take the life of any member of that class that is is responsible for that it never sat with me it never and even as a child it didn't you know I heard you say your oppression won't save you it won't I mean this is it it won't save you from these moral conflicts it won't save you from the these like moral quandries but Sean my feeling that that doesn't sit right with me my belief that somewhere on those plantations there was an enslaved black person that was that looked at that and said I can't get with this doesn't make enslavement right you understand recoiling at at horror at that death does not somehow make it difficult to pass judgment on the system I actually think they emanate from a I hope they emanate I think they emanate from a similar value and that is the value of of of human life I guess there's this broader question about how much context do we need in order to pass moral judgment and I'm not sure how answerable that question is got to go because what fair fair Ian Fair um this is what I thought you sound like me no I mean you sound like me this is what I thought like even like on the eve of the trip I was like boy this going to be really complicated like I thought the morality of it would be and I think part of it is and you know I want to say this is like there's a reason why I began that chapter in Yad vashem and it is because the fact of existential violence and Industrial genocide brought to the you know the Jewish peoples of of this world is a very very real thing and it's like how do you confront that and reconcile that with with Israel because you have you know you want that group of people to be okay you feel like that maybe that group of people is entitled to certain things you know I mean that in the best kind of way like they're entitled to a kind of safety given what happened to them you know you feel deep deep sympathy and so before I went I was like wow this is going to be morally like dicey I think you should go I'm not saying even saying you're going to agree with me like that's not what I'm saying I'm not saying you're going to end up where where I ended up but yeah I think you should go
