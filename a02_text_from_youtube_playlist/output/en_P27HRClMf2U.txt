this is a video made by a group of German physicists the circle in the background is a kind of mirror that combined with a special photography technique allows you to see the flow of air in this case it is showing how far air particles travel when someone breathes and when they cough which makes the respiratory particles travel further and faster this is what it looks like when someone coughs into their hand and into their elbow and this shows the travel of air particles when coughing while wearing two types of masks a dust mask and a surgical mask this isn't a scientific study it simply shows something face masks to do very well they limit how far away from new respiratory particles can travel but whether you've been told to wear a face mask to prevent the spread of kovat 19 probably depends on where you live in some East Asian countries it's already common practice some European countries have also started mandating face masks in public spaces but in the US the message from the federal government has been inconsistent there's no reason to be walking around with a mask it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain this is voluntary I don't think I'm gonna be doing it unless you live somewhere that mandates it whether you wear a face mask is probably up to you but making that decision for yourself is a lot easier if you understand what face masks can actually do and what they can't here's where the experts agree if you are sick and you leave the house you should wear a face mask because it keeps your germs in most of the uncertainty around masks is related to a separate question whether healthy people should wear them too right away though that distinction between sick with kovat 19 and healthy is more complicated than it sounds people who catch Cova 19 don't feel symptoms for five to six days on average and even up to 14 days but are contagious before that and based on what we know right now about 25% of people who catch it never show symptoms at all but are also contagious in other words especially with Cova 19 feeling healthy doesn't necessarily mean you don't have it I think we should all be acting and also all assume that we're infected Shan solon is an expert on global public health and Robert Hecht is a professor of clinical epidemiology and they say the possibility of being asymptomatic is one of the best cases for universal mask-wearing those who are actually infected and don't know it are showing almost no symptoms it's not maybe even primarily for their own health it's for the health of their family and neighbors but let's say you definitely a hundred percent do not have the virus the first thing you need to know is that no masks can actually guarantee you that you won't get it instead the best way to think about face masks is as part of a larger set of protective measures along with social distancing and hand washing used together they don't protect you completely but they dramatically lower your odds of infection I think of it as a protective triad with the virus trying to get in and if you don't have one of the branches in it and you're not protecting the whole thing and if you didn't have a mask could you do better with social distancing hand-washing sure but having all freeze it's really really important to understand how that works let's look at the two ways Koh v19 is transmitted one way is by touching an infected surface and the touch in your face this is called pho mite transmission and frequent hand-washing is the best defense against this but wearing face masks correctly can play a role two masks do a really good job of keeping you from touching your face the second way someone's respiratory particles can reach you is directly like this this is a slowed down recording of a sneeze it shows the kinds of respiratory particles that sneeze emits and how far they travel from a sick person these droplets are packed with millions of viral particles that fall in close range and in fact whatever they land on social distancing protects us from droplets by keeping you away from the particles emitted through sneezing coughing or even talking but face masks could help there too so someone who sneezes a couple feet away from you you know it'll protect some of the bigger splashes that also means face masks are especially important for people who don't have the privilege of being able to social distance that would be cops that would be grocery clerks taxis uber FedEx and UPS you know anyone who's coming into contact with a lot of people and maybe can't always maintain that six foot distance look at this video again though and you'll see that we also produce these longer range smaller particles which evaporate and can leave the virus hanging in the air these are called aerosols and we still don't really know how infectious they are for the average person but experts think they mostly pose a threat to medical workers who work up close to patients with Cova night team if you were a foot away from the patient who's copying as you're trying to intubate them aerosols are going everywhere for you and me you're just walking around walking your dog or in a grocery store your risk is is weighed higher from fomites a common mass that protects against aerosols is called an n95 respirator it's name comes from its materials ability to filter out 95% of aerosol particles it's also fitted to form a seal around your mouth and nose so there's no leakage in lots of places and 95s are in short supply because of diminished government stockpiles and disruptions and the supply chains and that's true for all disposable masks not just n95 that's why the u.s. Center for Disease Control says that unless you are a healthcare worker you shouldn't be using either an 95s or regular surgical masks they are needed in hospitals and the level of protection most people need can come from a simple cloth mask the CDC recommends any kind of tightly woven cotton for the masks or even a t-shirt you can make them by consulting the countless internet tutorials out there or buy them from the many vendors who manufacture them but they only work if you wear them correctly so what kind of masks are you wearing do you have them handy can you show us we thought you might guys this is all it takes to put it on just grab it by the loops keep your hands off the the central part put it over your nose and mouth loop it around the ears be careful not to touch it when you're outside keep your hands away from your face when you come back in after walking the dog we're doing the groceries do the same thing in Reverse put it off to the side don't start playing with it and then just at the end of the day pop it in the washer you wash it every day I wash them every night and you know even if you don't have a washer I mean you can hand wash them every night they're very small and they'll be tried by the next morning so if people can have a couple it would be better if you only have one then just wash it at night face masks highlight something important in the fight against Kovan 19 that it isn't always about protecting yourself it's about protecting the people around you and if everyone is doing it we all protect each other there's a visual messaging that comes from wearing a mask a reminder about everybody we're not in normal times now everyone needs to be doing everything they can to protect themselves and other people [Music] [Music]
