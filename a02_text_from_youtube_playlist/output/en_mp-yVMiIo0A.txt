if you're familiar with our YouTube channel you probably recognize a few voices like Sam is always going to use a map yeah the best videos I always have a map and Coleman's just going to show you a photo there's usually other photos in there Joss is going to drop a bunch of data on you but make you feel something if you really think about it our lives are just line charts these are people you don't always see on camera but you might recognize them just by their voices chip companies moves we see that the vaccine this is the first famous photograph as humans each of us produces a sound that's about as unique as a fingerprint there has never been somebody before currently or in the future that will sound like you so what is it that makes you sound like you [Music] this is your voice box it's called the larynx and it's located here the three main functions are to speak to breathe and to swallow Sandra stennett is a laryngologist which means she treats people who have trouble with any of these we're going to focus on speech obviously so you have articulatory function resonance function and then breath support let's start with breath if we open it up we can see the larynx is Hollow when you take a breath in the air comes down this way into your lungs when you speak or sing you push air from your lungs up through your trachea and through the vocal folds which you might know as vocal cords laryngologists we like to call them folds because they're just they're not chords they're folds the vocal folds are very very like pristine white bands they're made up of mucus covered muscles and cartilage as air pushes through it forces them open and then they snap closed and you can maybe imagine like a water balloon like if you took two water balloons and slapped them together and they go that vibration creates a sound wave the faster they vibrate the higher pitch the sound is for men it's about 100 to 200 Waves per second so kind of like a honeymoon bird wings and then for for women it's a little bit uh higher pitched so 200 plus Waves per second so it's fast if you try to raise the pitch of your voice stretch the vocal cords if you think of having a rubber band and you sort of pluck and then you stretch the band a little bit and then it gets to be a higher pitch the vocal folds work like that when we're on a low pitch they're short and then when we go higher they lengthen length and lengthen and there's a different tension that they have next is where resonance comes in that sound wave travels through your larynx and up into your oral and nasal cavities where it bounces around this on its own basically produces the sound of your voice but to make words we need to shape those sound waves using articulators things like our tongues lips teeth and various other features as humans we all essentially create sounds in the same way but differences in the size and shape of all of these things make our voices sound different physiologically we're each incredibly unique no two larynges are the same there's I mean that's it's like a fingerprint all of these different shapes and sizes contribute to you having a totally One of a Kind instrument there are other factors that play too on top of our physiological features the brain which is just like a complicated Circuit of nerves that manipulate pitch and emotion and inflection in the voice so you know when you say hi my name is Sandra or hi my name is Sandra your life's journey can impact your voice tremendously where you've lived what your job is who your friends are who your family is all of these factors change the way that you communicate in the way that you use your voice so for all of you absolutely roasting me for this video respect my journey I grew up in Jersey and then moved to Long Island I'm lucky I don't sound like Margot Robbie and Wolf of Wall Street since our voices are so specific to who we are it can be pretty drying when we go through major changes like in puberty testosterone in particular can drastically change a person's voice the men have a more rapid change in the physiology of their voice box we see a big change to the vocal cords they get bigger longer thicker more muscular and the larynx changes size and shape too that's why you have an Adam's apple those kinds of changes to the vocal folds and larynx can cause the voice to drop an entire octave but it's not like you're just stuck there just like any other muscle we can train our vocal folds to be more flexible the more they can stretch The Wider the range [Music] unfortunately as with any muscle your vocal folds will weaken over time which is why a lot of elderly people have that similar shaky raspy or scratchy voice it's called atrophy and so the vocal folds themselves have muscles inside and so they may uh get atrophy I like to compare it to I'm going to date myself Coming to America where the guys in the barbershop wait a second vocal coaches can help minimize this atrophy but you can also make sure you're doing things like staying hydrated and keeping out of situations that force you to strain your voice like yelling or Whispering Your Voice will inevitably change with time but that's not necessarily A Bad Thing The Voice itself is like a fingerprint but it's also a clue a clue to what type of person you are whether you're talkative or not you know where they're introverted or not I've always thought that like the larynx was a person's soul because it's so unique to everybody and it tells you a lot about a person [Music] mama [Music] and then we have [Music] way up there so that was an F seven
