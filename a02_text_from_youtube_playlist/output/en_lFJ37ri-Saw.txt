in september of 2019 a six-year-old student named kaya was sitting in her school's office okay she's gonna have to come with us now that's a police officer this video comes from his body camera at first it seems like kaya doesn't know what's happening [Music] earlier that day kaya had a tantrum three school employees said that she had kicked them the school called the police who arrested kaya on charges of misdemeanor battery the police dropped the charges after kaya's grandmother sent this video to the orlando sentinel kaia's case isn't an isolated incident [Music] a five-year-old girl being handcuffed by police in florida for a year he could not sleep alone he put handcuffs on me tossed to the ground by a school resource officer what you're seeing are the effects of a larger problem in american schools the u.s doesn't treat all students equally but if we wanted to we could do something about that the next president could decide if that happens [Music] in 2016 researchers at yale showed teachers this video clip of four preschool students their instructions look for misbehavior and click when you see it the study was kind of deceptive none of the kids in the video actually misbehaved the researchers were using eye tracking software what they actually wanted to study was who the teachers were watching both black and white teachers spent significantly more time watching the black boy in the video this study showed that even preschool teachers can treat kids differently based on their race without even realizing it look elsewhere in the u.s school system and you'll see this show up in other ways like at this middle school in bryan texas they gave students tickets for offenses like disrupting class or using profanity black students were four times more likely than white students to receive those tickets nationwide black boys miss way more school due to suspensions than any other group and this can start a kind of chain reaction missing weeks of school due to suspensions makes students much more likely to drop out without a diploma you're much less likely to earn a living wage and much more likely to be incarcerated all this missing school is helping to drive the highest poverty and incarceration rates in the developed world so it's worth asking how'd we get here in 1964 president lyndon johnson created a new federal office accountable to the president the office for civil rights its first task was to desegregate public schools in the south but soon they started noticing that some schools were segregating their students without actually calling it segregation a lot of the black students would be labeled disabled and removed from the mainstream classroom so they wound up segregated daniel lowson studies school discipline for years he's been sounding the alarm about how much school black students are missing due to suspensions the data he uses in his reports comes from the office for civil rights in the 1970s they started requiring schools to report how many students they classified as disabled plus suspensions and expulsions all broken down by race and gender over the next few decades those numbers went up as more punitive ideas about discipline took hold in american schools well in some schools gangs and drugs have taken over our streets and undermined our schools the idea that if you don't you know throw the book at kids when they're young for every little thing that they're going to turn into criminals it's never any research to show that it actually worked you never see that in schools serving mostly white kids but in 2011 a new report out of texas started to cast doubt on that approach the study looked at discipline records for almost a million students attract the same kids from seventh grade all the way through high school the results were stunning nearly 60 percent of students had been suspended or expelled at least once the study also showed that black students facing school discipline for the first time tended to get harsher punishments than white students and the more disciplinary violations a student received the more likely they were to drop out clearly texas had a big problem the question now was if the problem was bigger than texas to figure that out the obama administration turned to the data set that the office for civil rights had built that's how they learned this was a nationwide problem african american students are over three times more likely than their white peers to be suspended or expelled often for very similar offenses they also discovered that the vast majority of suspensions were for behaviors like talking back using profanity or violating the dress code non-violent student behaviors many of which once meant a phone call home the administration started investigating school districts where the numbers were the most damning one of those districts was bryan texas home of the discipline tickets in 2013 a woman named marjorie holman filed a complaint after her 12 year old son was suspended for defending himself from a bully and had to appear in adult criminal court the office of civil rights opened an investigation in brian along with hundreds of other school districts if you can't justify what you're doing and it's having a harmful impact on one group more than others you have to replace it with something else but we don't actually know if those changes made a difference because the most recent data on the office of civil rights website is from the 2015-2016 school year the year after that things started to change the 51-50 vote to confirm betsy devos the vice president votes in the affirmative and the nomination is confirmed in 2017 the office of president trump's new education secretary betsy devos sent a memo to the staff at the office of civil rights this one super jargony line in the memo signaled a huge shift ocr will only apply a systemic or class action approach where the individual complaint allegations themselves raise systemic or class-wide issues translation no more looking for patterns in the data if the office got a complaint like marjorie holman's they would look for one thing written or verbal proof that an individual teacher or administrator had punished marjorie's son more harshly because he was black we're not going to question that unless there's the smoking gun of intentional racism that's what happened in bryan texas when betsy devos took office the investigation into bryan's schools was close to wrapping up the final report concluded that black students were subject to disparate treatment when compared to white students engaged in the same or similar conduct they had dozens of recommendations for the district revise their discipline code hire mentors and social workers extra training for teachers devos's team scrapped the report and closed the investigation with no finding of wrongdoing and no suggestions for improvement if you look closely at this clip you can see joe biden standing right behind president clinton as he signs the 1994 crime bill that bill ushered in new tough on crime policies that devastated black communities as a senator biden played a key role in getting the bill passed we have predators on our streets they are beyond the pale many of those people and since then he's had to confront that history i haven't always been right the systematic racism that most of us whites don't like to acknowledge even exist it's been built into every aspect of our system this policy plan comes from the biden campaign in the section titled school discipline it says that biden would reinstate obama's discipline guidelines and would push for every state to submit a plan for reducing the use of policies and practices that push kids out of school some people believe that all racism is explicit a nasty slur a whites only sign a burning cross it's unmistakable and it's on purpose but there's another way of understanding racism that laws and policies can have racist outcomes even if they don't mention race at all that you don't always need a smoking gun to do a whole lot of damage thanks for watching this episode of our 2020 election series for this series we asked you what you wish the candidates would talk about more we got more than 12 000 responses and we made this video because a lot of you mentioned education racial justice
