st. Mark's Square Venice Italy it's one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world most years in mid-march it's crowded with people hanging out in cafes checking out the cathedral and writing gondolas but in March of 2020 st. Mark's Square was practically empty more and more people in northern Italy had tested positive for the highly contagious corona virus to slow down the spread of the virus the Prime Minister told everyone to stay home alone also del Italia in la nostra my and they listened a big part of the reason they could do that is because of a national policy in Italy everyone there is guaranteed paid sick days no matter their job the same is true in the UK and Germany and Spain and Japan and Ireland and Austria and Australia and Norway and France and well basically all wealthy countries but in the u.s. a huge number of workers face a very different reality these restaurant workers in New Orleans are demanding emergency sick pay during the corona virus pandemic unlike in all these countries there is no national law in the u.s. guaranteeing workers the right to paid sick days instead whether you have that right depends on where you live and who you work for it's a system that leaves tens of millions of the lowest paid Americans vulnerable and it's about to be tested by the biggest global pandemic in a hundred years if you look at how other countries handle paid sick leave some of them like Italy in Japan pay workers directly out of a social security fund others like Germany New Zealand and Australia have laws that require employers to foot the bill in Ireland and Spain it's a combination of both but they all do it for the same reason because it helps contain the spread of disease and can save lives when workers have to choose between making money and staying home when they're sick the incentive is for them to come to work which can get their customers and co-workers sick that's an especially big problem during a pandemic like coronavirus when hospitals might already be at capacity which would mean some people can't get medical attention which would mean more people would die that's why the website of the CDC America's main public health agency is unambiguous about what you should do if you're sick right now stay home but if staying home means not being able to pay your rent it might not be that simple I'm a production assistant I'm a music educator I work in Houston Texas as their stage head I am a line opener at a bakery by day a bartender by night and neither job offers paid sick days I don't get sick days because I'm not staff I'm hired like day to day I'm a contract worker so that means we're ineligible for benefits or paid sick leave at all if for any reason I have to call in sick the company caused an expression on the list and I do not get paid it basically means I start playing Tetris with my living expenses and pull money away from one bill to squeeze it into another so it makes things complicated and a bit scary in recent years service industry workers have pushed for new paid sick leave laws in cities and states across the country and in a handful of places they've succeeded but service workers are a huge part of every state's economy so why haven't they been more successful in getting paid sick days in more places part of the reason why starts here in Milwaukee Wisconsin in 2008 voters there passed a paid sick leave referendum by a huge margin but three years later the state's Republican Governor Scott Walker signed a bill that said no city in Wisconsin could require employers to provide their employees with leave of any kind Milwaukee's new paid sick leave law was toast then later that same year an executive from the company Yum Brands which owns KFC Taco Bell and Pizza Hut went to a meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council or Alec it's a group that rights legislation for Republican state lawmakers all over the country so they don't have to write it themselves they handed out copies of that Wisconsin bill in the decade sense republican-controlled state legislatures in 16 other states have passed nearly identical laws including Louisiana home of those New Orleans protestors but now that there's a pandemic the u.s. really needs sick workers everywhere to stay home that's partly why on March 18th 2020 president Trump signed a coronavirus relief bill that vice president Mike Pence described to the American people this way if you're sick stay home you're not gonna miss a paycheck the problem is that's not true the Democrats original bill gave everyone access to paid sick days but to get Republicans on board they made some concessions the bill does contain a line that says an employee shall be entitled to paid sick time during public health emergencies the problem is that rule only applies to companies with between 50 and 500 employees and companies that size only employ about 20% of American workers so even with this new bill millions of workers at big national chains like McDonald's Walmart Kroger and Pizza Hut still don't have paid sick days there are lots of American workers that do have paid sick leave many also have the privilege of working from home during the crisis but coronavirus doesn't distinguish between people who have that privilege and those who don't that means that the status quo puts all Americans at risk because we're only as safe as our least protected neighbors [Music] you
