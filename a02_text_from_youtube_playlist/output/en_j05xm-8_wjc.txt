at the October 13 1988 presidential debate Michael Dukakis in George HW Bush were asked who are the heroes who are there in American life today who are the ones that you would point out to young Americans as figures who should inspire this country I'm asked allant√© via darris those people that took us back into space again sports heroes Vice President Bush eventually responded with I think a doctor foul she probably never heard of you did and heard of he's a very fine research top doctor at National Institute of Health working hard doing something about research on this disease of AIDS today dr. Anthony SOG is best known because of his position in the coronavirus task force and for his many media appearances in the u.s. he's one of the most recognizable faces in the current crisis how did this doctor go from his research lab in Bethesda Maryland to becoming one of the most visible medical experts on the pandemic today thank you so much for taking the time to watch you see a doctor Anthony pouchy the June 5th 1981 weekly report by the Centers for Disease Control was a notable one it recorded five unusual cases of pneumonia these cases would become known as some of the earliest reports of AIDS the next year dr.
Anthony Fauci wrote in early paper about the disease which had increased to 290 recognized cases and had become a public health problem of essentially epidemic proportions now she worked at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases diet heading up a lab that studied immune system response nayad conducts research on diseases to help understand treat and prevent them it falls under the National Institutes of Health or NIH the medical research agency part of the Department of Health and Human Services in early 80s the NIH had many Institute's with nayad and National Cancer Institute leading investigation of the new virus and disease that would become known as hiv/aids Pfau she made that investigation the focus of his career today we're going to be listening to dr.
Anthony Fauci he's going to be talking about AIDS I'm working directly on on AIDS both clinically and from a basic science standpoint that really is one of the few of more actually one of the only subjects where you really have to change your lecture every month though she was named director of Nyad in 1984 and the then director of Health and Human Services highlighted vouches background in immunology and infectious diseases as a mean reason for his appointment AJ was directed at determining if a variant of this virus could actually cause depletion of lymphocytes or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and as it turned out a variant of that virus in fact caused the center of velji's leading early research helped define Nyad as the central NIH Institute for AIDS and he made it a point to be the person communicating key findings to the public and media the scientific data is overwhelming that in fact aids cannot be transmitted by casual contact but it was a later political test that shows how foul she navigated the AIDS crisis and secured his career in the summer of 1988 playwright Larry Kramer wrote an open letter to Anthony fashi calling him an incompetent idiot and a murderer his opinion was broadly reflective of activists most notably the organization kramer inspired the AIDS coalition to unleash power or act up in 1986 fowey had reinforced his position as the leading scientist for the federal-aid Zephyr he created a new division to focus on the disease and earned other significant NIH posts but progress was slow especially for a disease as deadly as AIDS where patients died on average 15 months after diagnosis pouchy and Nyad were responsible for starting trials for new drugs which the FDA required for approval in June 1986 Nyad created a network of clinical trial centers around the country though they were criticized as ineffective activists argued that the NIH the FDA and leadership up to prison Reagan had failed to take the crisis seriously this photo from an October 1988 protest shows the key complaints at the time the FTAs lengthy drug approvals required strict scientific clinical trials it was textbook science but the disease killed at a faster pace than the FDA's process if you entered a trial a certain percentage of patients got the drug and a certain percentage got a placebo this helped test if the drugs were safe and if they really worked that was important because many AIDS drugs didn't pan out but with aids getting a placebo was a death sentence and that meant fewer volunteers for clinical trials the epidemic needed a radical approach but experimental approaches like aerosolized pentamidine weren't being approved the drug helped treat one of the most common infections caused by AIDS yet trials had been delayed by nya which she blamed on insufficient staff under pressure he acknowledged the approval problem in 1988 testifying in Congress that he would go for what is available on the street if he were a patient a blunt rebuke to FDA policy keeping these new approaches out of reach foul she also went on to admit that it took them a long time to start trials of dextran sulfate a drug that had early enthusiasm among AIDS patients for the few approved options like the venn promising drug AZT activists criticized the high prices charged by maker Burroughs Wellcome all these issues had spawned large networks of buyers clubs AIDS patients who pooled their resources to import non fda-approved drugs in 1990 activists staged another major protest this time at the NIH in Bethesda Maryland where foul she worked it was a turning point in two key ways fashi incorporated these sharp activists criticisms and ideas into the government response in 1999 invited activist representatives into the administrative committee's for every AIDS clinical trial group this allowed for the government response to include on-the-ground knowledge starting in 1989 foul she had also voiced support for new program called parallel track forcing the FDA to consider it in it patients who couldn't participate in clinical trials could still get unapproved drugs once they've been tested for basic safety even if some drugs didn't work at least they would be available to try the de act up stormed the NIH in May 1990 the Federal Register published the FDA's plans to adopt a parallel track plan I'm dr. Anthony pouch nineteen years before Brad Pitt played in Phaneuf ouchy on Saturday Night Live SNL cast member Chris Kattan played him in 2001 drive during an anthrax scare two decades ago pouchy was already the face of public health response to unusual diseases that included everything from anthrax and flu updates to running the US government's massive AIDS treatment program in Africa under president george w bush all that's helped his relationship with activists bouchy called larry kramer a dear friend who was a longtime nemesis I remember he wanted to get my attention by writing an open letter to that incompetent idiot dr. Tony Fauci he needed to stir the pot by staying in the same role at Nyad since 1984 ouchy became a fixture across five NIH directors eight Centers for Disease Control directors and eight surgeons general they're appointed by the President and foul he's been around for six of them as the director of Nyad he's insulated from that political element the AIDS response in particular illustrates how fat she manages stakeholders from inside and outside the government and from above in below his position that in his scientific expertise has made him a constant during a new crisis to our recent advances of being able to isolate identify and characterize the agent together with the advances in understanding the natural history and pathophysiology of this disease will allow us over the next year to come back to you and tell you that we now not only have hope and hypothesis but that we have a real prevention and indeed a real cure [Music] you you
