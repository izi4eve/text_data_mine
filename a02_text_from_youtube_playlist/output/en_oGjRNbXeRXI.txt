cities along the coast were already being developed but the Amazon which covers almost half the country was remote inaccessible and home to tens of thousands of indigenous people who had lived there for centuries around the 1920s brazil's government pushed an aggressive plan to change the shape of the amazon it brought telegraph lines roads schools and people into the amazon while forcibly pushing these indigenous groups out of the way then in the 1960s a brutal military dictatorship took over brazil and carried out genocide against indigenous people they took away their lands to build highways mines and dams across the Amazon during this time more than eighty three hundred and isness people were killed and tens of thousands had lost their homes in 1985 the military regime collapsed and Brazil became a democracy the new constitution included historic reparations for the country's indigenous people it recognises their culture and traditions and even gave them a way to get their lands back indigenous groups could claim their traditional territory with a government agency called Funai that would demarcate the borders of a new protected land after final approval from Brazil's

be threatened again from the 90s to 2000 Brazil's economy was one of the fastest growing in the world fuelled primarily by agriculture the country became one of the top producers of beef and soybeans while logging and mining were also significant industries but the economic boom had a downside all of these industries needed more and more land a lot of which came from the Amazon the rainforest was rapidly cut down in Para Rondonia and Mata Grosso States to make room for cattle pastures and farms often leaving the protected indigenous lands as the only forests left before long Brazil's agricultural industry wanted to gain access to these areas too and they found support within the government they lobbied to weaken the rules around protected indigenous lands that they claimed were barriers to progress and their pressure started to show results from 2003 to 2010 President Lula da Silva approved 87 indigenous reserves but its successor Dilma Rousseff approved just 21 followed by Michel temer who only one Rousseff antemer also cut through noise funding which forced the agency to close dozens of offices in the Amazon leaving indigenous people unprotected as Funes Power declined
