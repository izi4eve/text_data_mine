when you land the quarantine process immediately begins they spray down all your bags you have to take a quarantine taxi specifically designated to take you from where you're going to your quarantine i got to this hotel and we went down into like the uh the cargo entrance and in it is this like screen with like a person on the other side of a webcam and they just basically told me like take that elevator don't touch anything and it will like program it to go up to your floor this is ed i wanted to talk to him because in 2020 he was one of more than half a million people who went through a mandatory two-week quarantine and then walked out into taiwan ed has dual citizenship in taiwan and canada but he lives in new york i do too and for most of 2020 in new york the streets were empty venues were closed but taiwan was normal it's as if the pandemic had never happened you could go into restaurants subway civil society had essentially stayed exactly the same through all of 2020 taiwan had a total of seven covet 19 deaths seven among the lowest in the world [Music] and then in may of 2021 something changed taiwan is now experiencing rising daily infections huge surge largest wave taiwan is now grappling with its worst outbreak after more than a year of normalcy taiwan faced its biggest covet outbreak ever so i wanted to understand how did taiwan stay so safe from covet 19 for so long why did it stop working and what can we learn from it through the streets of taipei a major parade symbolic of the fighting spirit of nationalist china's army in the fortress island taiwan started out relatively poor and under a military dictatorship but by the 1990s it had become a democracy and was experiencing an economic boom the government developed the national health insurance system which provided universal healthcare to 99 of the population this put taiwan on par with wealthy countries around the world well other than the us in 2001 they began to implement smart cards that stored patients medical information digitally that combination of universal healthcare and the digital infrastructure would come to be regarded as one of the best healthcare systems in the world then in 2003 china began reporting an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome by march 2003 sars was in taiwan cases started rapidly appearing in hospitals primarily in taipei in april a large cluster of cases was reported at this hospital in response the mayor of taipei abruptly decided to seal the hospital off preventing anyone from entering or leaving more than 150 people trapped inside became infected of the more than 80 people who eventually died of stars in taiwan 31 had been locked in that hospital the government's response to sars was chaotic to handle the logistics of the outbreak they'd set up a temporary agency called the central epidemic command center but when it came time to figure out who had been responsible for locking down the hospital officials at all levels of government disagreed on whose decision it had actually been we've had a lot of problems of say the municipal government saying one thing and the central government's saying anata so in 2004 the role of the cecc was clarified when activated during an outbreak this agency would now become the central public health authority with access to information across government agencies we've got a lot of public infrastructure that's made like lego blocks where people can very easily recombine it to produce new functionalities over the next 15 years the cecc was activated during three smaller outbreaks but the real test was yet to come on december 31 2019 taiwan's government learned that at least seven atypical pneumonia cases had been reported in wuhan china and on january 20th they officially activated the cec because the cec could share information across agencies it was able to integrate citizens travel data with their health data together that combination allowed them to assess risk at the level of the individual people who had recently traveled to countries where they could have been exposed were considered high risk people with no underlying health issues who hadn't traveled abroad were considered low risk everyone in taiwan had that information sent to their smart card altogether it created a system that looked something like this low-risk people were instructed to buy a weekly quota of mosques allocated by the government but they'd continue to live in a functional normal society high-risk people went into a two-week quarantine after which they'd become low-risk and could join everyone else because of this taiwan didn't have to go into lockdown community spread among people in taiwan was very very low but in march cases coming into taiwan began to rise so taiwan came up with an additional strategy it started considering everyone flying in to be high risk no matter where they were coming from and most foreign travelers were banned completely that meant a lot more mandatory quarantine to enforce this the cecc used cell phone location data to see if any travelers left their quarantine block the moment you close the door you see on the back end there's like this huge red scary sign that says you're going to be fined a lot of money if you leave your quarantine you would get texts from the neighborhood police officer whose job it is to call and check in on you every single day actually twice a day for two weeks the only human contact it had was through a peephole when someone came to drop off food or collect his trash but then he got to join the nearly 24 million people in taiwan living normal lives this was an alternate universe of what america and the rest of the world had seen all year the taiwanese people have been able to just live their lives as if nothing had happened like to me that's freedom when i started making this video it was a story about how taiwan managed to beat covet but in may of 2021 a new wave of cases suddenly put taiwan's success in question the total number of cases has actually doubled more shops are going to be forced to close do not be complacent in the face of a pandemic the lesson learned for taiwanese taiwan had gradually loosened its quarantine system which meant incoming infections started to go unchecked as of this video taiwan is still getting its outbreak under control thousands of people have been sent through new rounds of quarantine but even taiwan won't be truly safe until the system it built to keep the pandemic out is no longer necessary and the best way we know of to get there is to vaccinate on the flip side after a very hard year new york looks kind of normal again but it's not because we finally figured out how to contain covid it's because of the vaccine this will happen again and we can't just be like oh well you know there was a vaccine so it's all good at the end of all this even once we're all vaccinated and going to parties again we should look at what did taiwan do right so that we don't have to have the same conversation in the future because it is coming for more than a year taiwan stayed safe and free during a deadly pandemic but in a fight against a pandemic mistakes are going to happen the trick is to learn from them you
