You guys ready?
We're all hopping on different modes of transportation to explain the design choices behind the ways we travel.
I'm so excited.
Maybe this was a mistake.
We can now build cruise ships that are as long as the Empire State Building is tall.
How do they do that?
You've arrived at LaGuardia Airport.
Why does it feel like I'm getting less legroom on planes than I used to?
The US used to have the biggest and most well-funded rail network in the world.
What the heck happened?
To find out the answer to that I’m going to take the Amtrak from here in Los Angeles all the way to New York City.
Oh! There’s an RV.
Why does every RV I see have the same swishes and swoops?
I'm going to the RV capital of the world to find out.
I just did a crazy turnaround because I just saw the coolest looking RV.
So I'm going on a little East Coast road trip...
and I'm 99% sure that most of the cars...
are going to be bigger than mine.
It's a 70 hour journey.
I guess I better get started.
