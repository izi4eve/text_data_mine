if you're on the film side of Tik Tok like I am you may have seen videos going around that show what famous movies would look like if they were framed for our phones they're kind of sick and they all seem to have been released right after the debut of photoshop's new generative fill tool as the name implies the tool allows you to generate imagery with a simple text prompt in these videos they're using this tool as a really technologically advanced film making technique one that's been used for over a 100 years albeit with a totally different skill set so will AI be the next evolution of the matte [Music] painting when it comes to traditional matte paintings you might think of something like this from The Wizard of Oz Dorothy and friends are real but the Emerald City isn't really there it's just an illustration using this technique filmmakers were able to make an impossible world look real at a much cheaper price tag than building a full set this one was made with crayons but usually map paintings are painted on glass like in Mary Poppins or Star Wars which is maybe the best example because you know everybody likes star I was never a Star Wars fan which is hard to admit for me it was alien Blade Runner when the Matrix came out was the like final like what is that I want to do that for a living I'm Max Burman I spent over a decade working as a matap painter in film and games the co-founder of Kash 3D Max is here to help me explain how matte paintings went from oil paint on glass to this in terms of the transition from traditional to digital there's a couple chapters of this the first one is Photoshop we can paint in layers and layers changes everything for us we can go backwards and forwards we can be working on the background and the foreground separately and having every brush imaginable and every color imaginable now this is the first digital map painting and it still feels like a painting because it kind of was the tools were different but we brought a painting technique to that digital then we kind of moved into what's called photo bashing I did a film called her I was responsible for doing all the map paintings of future La I had backpacked through southeast Asia for about 6 weeks with the camera so I would be pulling from all of those photographs from my travels to say what if we used kind of Bangkok as a starting point and then we modified the architecture to look more like la so did traditional mat painters see photo bashing as they sort of cheat like whoa you don't have to paint anything anymore that's not fair some of the other more senior map painters be like what the hell are you doing over there every era of a technology change it's looked at as cheating until it becomes common place we'll hear more about the next big step forward of mat painting after a message from this video sponsor this episode is presented by Microsoft co-pilot for Microsoft 365 your AI assistant at work co-pilot can help you solve your most complex problems at work going far beyond simple questions and answers from getting up to speed on a missed teams meeting in seconds to helping you start a first draft faster in word

comprehensive approach to security privacy compliance and responsible AI Microsoft does not influence the editorial process of our videos but they do help make videos like this possible to learn more you can go to microsoft.com forwork now back to our video the next big step forward for matap painting was to push those 2D layers into 3D space which Max did on Iron Man 3 using the compositing program nuke for those shots I painted a bunch of clouds and they were all on layers and then I painted the landscape and the sky behind it and all of that was set up as a projection so that as we mooved the camera with Iron Man back you could see the clouds moving and him getting further and further away from the shoreline yeah I actually found this example really interesting because Iron Man is already being made in 3D so why not just make the whole shot 3D it is way cheaper and easier and and more achievable to paint a photorealistic cloud than it is to do a 3D simulation of a realistic Cloud at least in that time so for a lot of those more expansive establishing shots bringing in a mat painter could circumvent a lot of that but 3D tools caught up it is just as fast if not faster today to actually create that environment in 3D than it would be in 2D Max's company actually helps speed the process up in some ways their pre-built assets are meant to be dragged and dropped helping artists quickly build worlds like you can see in this teaser for their Manhattan kit if you're using our Manhattan kit you're using the same exact thing that doctor strange is using on on their films technology is getting a lot better these days rendering and Computing is cheaper than ever and because of that you know the need for a 2d artist is becoming less and less valuable but what about a 2d artist that can make a mat in seconds now I am not skilled enough to have ever pulled anything like this off on on my own but even artists who do have those skills might one day have to start adding AI to their toolbox I think it's just early days in this tool and we have some more work to do as someone who's learned how to communicate via visuals composition lighting color all of these are my ways of expression and these are not the things that today AI is picking up and working with tools like nvidia's AI canvas could begin to bridge that Gap as it takes simple brush strokes and transforms them into photo realistic images but obviously these tools aren't the same as a paintbrush digital or physical because with this what you see is exactly what you get with these tools there's a gap between what you put in and what you get out of it getting exactly what you want ends up being an iterative process often involving dozens of prompts plus some paintbrush tinkering in Photoshop or another app so right now these tools are thriving with individual creators but in Hollywood I have not seen anyone or any production utilize it in production and I think there's a couple reasons for it one it's not there yet it's close and it's getting better real quick but it's not there today the other part of it is the legalities of you know who owns the work that's being generated who owns the data that it was trained on ultimately it's going to change everything I I think we can't deny that and ultimately human plus computer Beats human and beats computer um it is the marriage of these two in which technolog always [Music] shined
