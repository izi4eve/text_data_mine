the time for social distancing its immediate late what exactly is social distancing social distancing Institute more social distancing my name is karellen canoe CEO and I'm a social epidemiologist every action that we take and every way in which we can hold back from the public sphere in order to limit the opportunities for transmission is an opportunity truly to save a life I'm wondering if there are just one or two concrete pieces of advice you would want people to follow I think our lives should look radically different right now than they normally do I would say limit your face-to-face interactions work remotely whenever possible no handshakes no high-fives no hugs outside the home stand six feet or more away from any person you're encountering in a public space and severely restrict your travel from city to city limiting that to truly urgent matters and limit your engagement in the public sphere don't attend group gatherings don't go to the theater don't go to sporting events what we're trying to prevent is contact with droplets when people sneeze cough or spit I'm wondering what you think of small social gatherings how big is too big you will get different answers from different people about this and I tend to be more conservative one of my son said to me mom if we're quarantined at least we can still have dinner parties right and I said no Gabriel that's the antithesis of what quarantine is about we have to minimize our contact with others I would say that's the general rule limited limited to what's necessary do you recommend that people go outside even if they have limited contact with people so what I've been doing is trying to wake up at a very early hour and go usually or to go in very unpopulated places and walk I'm wondering what you think about taking flights an important consideration is that the movement of populations is the fuel for continued spread so in the 1918 flu there was this massive movement of troops across the United States and that troop movement was the perfect vehicle for continuing the spread of influenza and you may think that it's different if you're just traveling for spring break but really there isn't any difference between that kind of movement for the purposes of wartime personnel needs and the movement of people because they want to get to the beach we don't want to have prolonged contact with other humans in a confined space and what's a flight if not prolonged contact with other humans than a confined space so don't do it if you don't have to do it don't do it I'm sure that's gonna be your answer for all of the following questions I have if you don't have to don't do it what about public transportation so many people are dependent upon public transit to get to work there might be some risk reduction practices people could adopt such as trying to ride at off-peak times if you are able to walk or ride your bike do that it probably is safer from a an infection perspective to drive one's own car rather than to use public transit but every public health person hates saying that how should we approach caring for elderly or at-risk neighbors or people in our community who may need help if people have been living with an elderly family member they should reduce radically their contact with the outside world especially the primary caregiver that's ultra important for elders who are able to take care of their own activities of daily living like my mom lives independently she's taking the CDC advice very seriously to stay at home and we also make a point to call her multiple throughout the day my daughter in the evening will read a story to my mom my mom will read a story to her we play games together over Google Hangouts we really want to have ways to continue to show her how much we love her and when will this end when will we know that we can stop social distancing I can't give you a date when it will end it would be good if we could have that date because it would be reassuring to people to know that this won't last forever and it won't last forever but it's probably going to be an uncomfortably long period of time is there a happy medium between extreme social isolation and just keeping a healthy distance from people so this will be a very hard time for many people and I would say that the happy medium is to try to think creatively about ways to engage socially without physically being present call more often FaceTime more often sing with friends out the windows as people have been doing in Italy play music for your loved ones over the phone let your elders hear the voices of their grandchildren over the phone give to food banks give to homeless outreach organizations if you're able to be generous now is the time to be generous and be generous not just with our material gifts but also truly believe deep in your heart that by stepping out of the social realm right now you are doing one of the greatest services you can do to the public's health [Music]
