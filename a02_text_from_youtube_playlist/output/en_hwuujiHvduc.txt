when you think of an american farm you probably think of something like this a barn a field a diverse group of animals [Music] until relatively recently if you ate meat it probably came from a farm that looked basically like this and that was true around the world but in the last few decades the global production of meat has skyrocketed and that's been driven by a change in how livestock is raised in order to increase profits and raise livestock more cost effectively farms like this one started to consolidate and to mechanize take chicken farms for example in the 1970s the u.s had around 30 thousand chicken farms by 1995 it had only about 20 000 but the amount of chicken produced in the u.s had tripled this is what one of those consolidated farms looks like farms like this are controversial there are ethical concerns environmental concerns but infectious disease experts worry about them for a different reason [Music] a farm like this is called a concentrated animal feeding operation or cafo cafos are basically huge industrialized farming operations they contain tens of thousands of animals sometimes hundreds of thousands of animals and they're often very crowded american cafos were efficient and profitable and soon they became a model for farming all over the world today almost all the meat we eat comes from farms like this factory farms supply an estimated 90 of meat globally and around 99 of the meat we eat here in the u.s so if you're eating a burger or bacon or whatever it is today it probably came from a factory farm a cafo is an environment built for one purpose to house as many animals as possible what worries scientists is that that also makes it an ideal environment for the pathogens that cause pandemics a virus is really just a bit of genetic code that makes copies of itself but that replication process isn't always perfect they're introducing lots of mutations as they replicate martha nelson studies viruses at the national institutes of health most of those mutations are going to be deleterious and you know won't help the virus at all lots of mutations just lead to the virus dying but occasionally a mutation will happen that will give the virus a new ability to be more deadly for example or to be able to jump from one species to another a virus can only replicate when it's inside another organism a host but it can only replicate inside a host for so long every host eventually dies that means even if a virus does mutate in a beneficial way without hosts that mutation will eventually die out and out in the wild or even on a small farm new hosts can be hard to come by but in a cafo let's say you're a pathogen if you're in a factory farm where you have hundreds of thousands of potential hosts it's a bonanza more hosts means more chances to replicate more chances to mutate and a higher likelihood that a mutated virus will survive in other words factory farms are also factories for new viruses that we haven't seen before and that's also helped along by the larger system that kfos are a part of there's a lot of international trade going on of live animals we're sending these animals from city to city and from country to country we're flying them across oceans some viruses have a genetic code that's segmented into parts and sometimes two of these viruses come into contact with each other occasionally you can have two separate viruses co-infect a single cell when they replicate they can just kind of swap out entire segments with the other virus and through that you can kind of create these chimeric you know offspring that have pieces from the two parents just like with mutations this swapping and shuffling of segments between viruses is basically random and that means sometimes the new virus is a dud but every now and then you hit jackpot and you come up with a radically new combination that has properties that neither of the two parents had in cafos viruses have an opportunity to come into contact with each other all the time that's making it easier for a virus that exists over here on one side of the world that normally would just stay on that side of the world to travel quite quickly to another part of the world with viruses from different parts of the world mixing and shuffling and mutating inside animals humans have made it very easy for a nasty virus to emerge and actually it's happened already we are continuing to closely monitor the emergency cases of the h1n1 flu virus in 2009 a new virus quickly spread around the world it became known as the swine flu because of its links to pig farms in north america it came from the major swine production region that's right outside of mexico city that particular virus was able to evolve there because you have pigs coming from the united states over the border into mexico you have pigs from europe and so you have this sort of mixing bowl of pigs from all over the world that are able to share their viruses and exchange genetic components and create this really unusual pandemic variant by the time public health measures and a vaccine were able to get it under control swine flu had killed hundreds of thousands of people but viruses are just one kind of pathogen that kfos are really good at incubating [Music] because bacterial disease can spread so easily in a cafo farmers typically treat their livestock with antibiotics which limits the bacteria's spread and often every animal gets that antibiotic whether they're sick or not at first that prevents bacterial disease from running rampant through the population but over time just like viruses bacteria will mutate the antibiotic will kill most of these mutations unless the mutation gives them the ability to resist it and over time as the bacteria evolve those that have the mutation to survive the antibiotic will become more and more dominant this is how we end up with antibiotic resistant bacteria and that becomes really dangerous if it spreads into humans and so then when we humans come along and try to treat the bacteria with antibiotics in our own bodies the bacteria might not respond to those antibiotics one way to lower the risk of kefoborn pathogens would be to change the cavo system to make the spread of pathogens harder we could decrease the long-distance transport of live animals we can have smaller and less crowded farms so that pathogens don't have so much opportunity to rip through huge numbers of animals but making kefos safer for humans wouldn't address the other concerns about them like animals quality of life or the lagoons of liquid manure they produce ending kefos entirely and returning to a smaller model of farming would it's actually entirely possible for us to have a meat production system that is better for human health as well as for the climate and for the animals themselves we just need to abandon factory farming to get that we could also just eat less meat after all the amount of meat we eat today is a recent development but now that we know what it's like to experience a pandemic we should understand the risks of the animal pathogens cooking in our food systems it's just a matter of time before one ends up in the human population whether that happens next year whether that happens in a decade you know that's a crystal ball we don't know but we do know that we are playing with probabilities and we're continually increasing the probability as we increase the pool of viruses in these farms [Music] you
