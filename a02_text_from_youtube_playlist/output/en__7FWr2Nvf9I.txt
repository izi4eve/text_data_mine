there's a certain look that's taken over everything a certain color palette kind of font and design today this visual style sells us meal kits and underwear and monthly toothbrush subscriptions and just about everything else but it's also showing up here in seemingly harmless trendy instagram posts about child trafficking on instagram there are over 800 000 posts like this from social media influencers and regular users with the hashtag save the children we've seen things like this before slideshows about social justice and current events dominated instagram this summer but something else is happening here on facebook membership in pages and groups branded as anti-child trafficking grew three thousand percent between july and the end of september by the end of august in-person rallies started taking place in cities across the world ending child trafficking is hardly controversial but behind that surge in growth is the baseless conspiracy theory known as q anon now an ideology once confined to the more obscure parts of the internet is finding its way mainstream one instagram post at a time on october 28 2017 the first of a series of posts from an anonymous user appeared on the 4chan message board paul the user was nicknamed q after q level security clearance that's the energy department equivalent of top secret the community that followed and believed those anonymous postings became known as q anon and they developed an elaborate conspiracy theory lore that president trump is fighting a global trial trafficking network led by satanic cannibalistic left-wing pedophile elites their theories have been proven false time and time again but that didn't stop the community from spreading from 4chan to another messaging board 8chan and to places like twitter youtube and facebook and as it did the posts videos and memes explaining its ideology became more accessible and digestible now qnon is a giant entanglement of conspiracy theories with dozens of offshoots that invites all different kinds of conspiratorial thinking into its fold kyoto has always been a big tent conspiracy theory that invites people of different beliefs and the thing is because the q a narrative is so broad and sprawling people can kind of enter it and pick out the the things that they like the best that paired with the facebook algorithm which uh recommends like other groups that someone might be interested in that turns into a very uh dangerous combination the q anon follower blocked the hoover dam with an armored vehicle a far right conspiracy theorist was planning a kidnapping and douglas guy a 24 year old man was charged in the shooting death of a reputed mob boss his attorneys argued he was motivated by q anon in 2019 the fbi labeled hunon as a potential domestic terror threat after some q anon followers started committing serious crimes in the real world on facebook q anon related activity grew steadily for years without consequences but then something changed there is a lot of evidence that suggests that the pandemic had a big effect on the growth of q anon the the impact of people spending a lot more time indoors and being online a lot more combined with the stress of the pandemic and the uncertainty of the future uh that was a toxic combination that pushed people into q a in march three leading q and on facebook group saw their membership rise from under fifty thousand to over three hundred thousand by august an internal investigation in facebook reviewed by nbc found that a number of qnon groups and pages had more than 3 million followers on august 19th facebook announced that it would be banning hundreds of q on pages and groups and after that traffic for q and on phrases and hashtags fell but membership in groups posing as anti-child trafficking groups exploded and in those groups users were still largely spreading q anon content q anon followers had simply pivoted to a new hashtag to improve their image one that was already being used for a fundraising campaign by a uk-based charity save the children i suppose for someone like me who's kind of been covering q and on for the past number of years like the past six months have kind of been you know it's kind of been like watching a tsunami in slow motion save the children is as i say it's a simple rebrand of cubanon it's a very simple and effective message to bring the q on movement to a wider audience you know who doesn't want to save children it's hard to accurately trace how the save the children hashtag jumped from these cute on facebook groups to mainstream accounts on instagram but by july high profile accounts like model helen owen and the real housewives of orange county's kelly dodd boosted the hashtag with inaccurate or misleading statistics this coincided with the united nations human trafficking awareness day other accounts put together slideshow style infographics like these and these are all packaged up in very pretty posts that are you know essentially they're very easily digestible especially to people that are not familiar with q and on their their colors are so a lot softer there's a lot of pastels and it's very pretty and nice and and when if you look at it without reading the words you would think it would be just like just any other kind of uh yoga inspired um you know instagram post and so the move to instagram kind of brought you know it brought cuban on to this kind of lifestyle influencer circle really and many of these influencers already they already have very high followings and they already have a dedicated audience that will you know very much listen to what they have to say accounts that might otherwise be getting just a few hundred likes on posts found themselves getting tens of thousands of likes as soon as they started posting about save the children a lot of people who get into q a especially if they're struggling influencers they notice that these q and themes they're like an internet cheat code because they attract people who are very engaged they spend a lot of time online and if you start promoting keyword on themes you start noticing that you're getting a lot more likes and shares that could be a big incentive to keep doing it perhaps the most damaging part of the save the children movement is how inaccurate information is making it harder to fight actual trafficking one of these most often cited statistics is that 800 000 children go missing every year in the u.s that number comes from a 2002 survey that asked parents if they had reported their children as runaways sometime in the previous year 797 and 500 said that they had the 2019 fbi data puts that number closer to 421 000.
roughly half of those reports are related to custody disputes and the rest mostly relate to runaways but even then that number refers to children who are reported missing by their parents the vast majority of whom over 99 percent return home within hours or days in that 2002 study only 115 were considered stereotypical kidnappings there's no reliable data on how many people are trafficked in the u.s each year but stereotypical kidnappings aren't what trafficking usually looks like instead it often takes the form of forced labor or wage theft most commonly in agriculture domestic work or sex work and the people most at risk are those already vulnerable youth experiencing homelessness in foster care or unstable housing lgbtq plus youth who have been kicked out of their homes or migrant young people most people kind of have this idea in their head that it's you know children being lifted off the streets and been shipped overseas you know and you know all of that that does happen it doesn't happen at all to the extent that you and unfollowers believe that it does but the hysteria caused by distorted numbers has led to a deluge of calls and outreach from concerned q anon followers and it's overwhelming the organizations fighting actual child trafficking and that's very damaging because it made it harder for people with real information about possible human trafficking victims to get through and so we've seen this actually repeatedly the ways in which the misinformation that this that this kind of save the children style of q anon is uh is promoting damages real efforts to actually help children you won't find any searchable hashtags with typical q and on language on instagram anymore but because save the children isn't an inherently harmful tagline moderating it has proven particularly difficult and tackling misinformation on instagram can be harder than on facebook since it's harder to train an algorithm to recognize misleading text in slideshow images than it is to recognize text in facebook posts or comments the belief in q anon definitely falls along a spectrum i don't think you can say that everyone that was how to say if the children rally believes that hillary clinton needs children it's the hysteria it's the hysteria that grows and grows and grows as you're going down that rabbit hole that could more than likely eventually lead to you thinking that hillary clinton needs children cuon has really struck on something clever in that people get confused in their own way and they fall down their own individual rabbit holes that that radicalize them according to their own personality type there are more than 20 candidates for congress who have expressed support for q anon the real danger is that people don't need to believe or even be aware of the entirety of a conspiracy theory for it to start influencing their decisions you
