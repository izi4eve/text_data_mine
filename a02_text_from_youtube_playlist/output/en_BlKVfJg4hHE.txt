it's December 2nd 2010 and the International Federation of association football or FIFA gathered in Switzerland to announce which country would host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups and they had assembled a powerful audience here's former U.S President Bill Clinton who was there to back the U.S bid and here's Prince William working on behalf of England's bid behind him is the prime minister of the Netherlands and former Prime Minister of Belgium who together submitted a joint bid but even with all this political power in one room the fate of their countries lay in the hands of these guys the 22 FIFA officials with the power to pick the host they would consider the goals for the bidding Nations they were the masters of their Destiny but many of these men have been accused of abusing their power and this was the moment they took it a step too far 2018 FIFA World Cup ladies and gentlemen will be organized in Russia 22 FIFA World Cup is Qatar decision is still one of the worst decisions made by sporting organization it was catastrophic for feedback they've had their whole legacies called into question the announcement set off at Cascade of events that rocked the world of football and nearly broke FIFA a rampant and deep-rooted Corruption corruption and widespread corruption in the interfering and money laundering how did FIFA go from organizing one of the most beloved sporting events in the world to corrupting it [Music] red in the early 20th century football was already super popular mainly in Europe and South America where national teams had begun playing each other so a group of officials in France formed FIFA in 1904 to oversee these competitions and promote the sport in 1930 inspired by the Olympics they decided to start their own tournament the first question was who would host it out of FIFA's 44 member countries at the time six placed bids to host it FIFA's Congress made up of one representative from each country was put in charge of voting for a winner but really this vote was a facade so there was no bid contests as such it was effectively decided Behind Closed Doors by a bunch of commencing men eventually FIFA awarded Uruguay the rights to host the first World Cup and it was a Fitting Place to do it Uruguay had just won the last two Olympic gold medals in football but it also agreed to pay for a lot including the travel expenses of other teams and share the profits with FIFA in July 1930 13 teams came together to play Uruguay beat Argentina in the finals and FIFA made a solid profit mostly from ticket sales the World Cup was a success over the next couple of decades FIFA decided to rotate the tournament between Europe and South America the World Cup wasn't a grandiose thing back then you know there were some upgrades to the stadiums to the existing infrastructure and a piece of marketing going on but the World Cup wasn't wasn't a truly Global event that all changed when it went on TV I am very pleased that this country is acting as hers for the final of the World Cup once the whole world can watch the tournament the host nation became much more visible leading many more countries to want to host one in virtually every country football has now such a following that no government can afford to ignore it through the 60s and 70s FIFA's membership started exploding by the 80s it had close to 170 members mostly divided into six confederations with their own qualifying tournaments and the organization kept getting richer take a look at how FIFA's profits greased deadly with almost every tournament until Boom the 1980s that's when World Cup sponsorships merchandise and TV rights became worth millions all of this money was largely controlled by 24 officials the leaders of each Confederation and some senior officials like the president this group was called the executive committee or xco they had the power to distribute FIFA's money to its member countries for building football fields holding tournaments and establishing youth programs varial this system about any checks and played lots of money was cycling though you know a development money Kickback became almost standard practice in certain parts of the world FIFA leaders began using Corrupt Practices to gain and retain power the corruption that went on suit to the two presidents avalandra's nakedly corrupt and Arlington bribes that's well documented set glass was very different he was addicted to power there was a cabal of nakedly corrupt committee men within people and Mr blatter ignored their excesses because he relied on their support to keep himself in power it was in this culture of corruption that FIFA in 1964 decided to take the vote away from Congress and give it to exco meaning that to host a World Cup countries only needed to win the votes of a majority of exco just 13 of them the fact that such a small body of and had such a powerful position vested among them without any real checks and balances yeah it absolutely made corrupt sheep part of it FIFA's corruption wasn't a secret but they had moved their headquarters to Switzerland long ago and that meant their finances couldn't really be traced to confirm corruption at least for another decade the 2006 World Cup bid was the most competitive in FIFA's history it had previously begun accepting bids from countries outside of Europe and South America it awarded hosting rights to the U.S in 94 and South Korea and Japan in 2002 for the 2006 World Cup five countries wanted to hosted and for good reason I think there's a huge amount of prestige that it brings to not just the country but the leadership of the country it's sort of a a step on the way towards nation building with more and more countries desperate for World Cup Prestige FIFA found ways to play them off each other the bidding countries spent millions of dollars on a two-year Gauntlet of PR events to impress FIFA and try to outdo each other by promising new stadiums hotels infrastructure and lucrative tv offers this became the well-known public-facing side of the bidding process that was the start I think where the World Cup became really very heavily politicized when the 2006 vote came to a close exco chose foreign thanks to one voter abstaining at the last moment journalists had later revealed that Germany had bribed at least four exco members for their votes including the official who abstained who was the first publicly reported incident that revealed FIFA had another layer to its bidding process that involved cutting deals with XCOM members under the table because of a lack of criteria that governed by the World Cup was going to go the old man who stuck on its executive committee were whined and dined and indulged for a significant period of time and in some cases you know quite handsomely renumerated and it happened again for the 2010 World Cup bid which South Africa won allegations would later emerge that it too had paid ex-co-members for their votes this shadier side of the bid was becoming vital to winning and in the next two bids it would destroy the legacy of the World Cup in the lead-up to this announcement FIFA had decided that the 2018 cup would be in Europe four bidders emerged England with its expansive infrastructure was the heavy favor for the same reasons the US was a favorite among five bidders for 2022.
but of course this was only part of what it took to win a World Cup bid the countries that did win the vote that day were the ones who could pour the most money into all levels of FIFA system [Music] people often either look Russian you know Rush is very much at the Forefront of everybody's mind as long as someone like Vladimir Putin were behind it then they were always going to be very competitive in that process this is Bonita merciaris she saw the World Cup bidding process from the inside while working on Australia's bid that same year they had the capacity they had the technical capability they had the facilities Russia pledged to spend 10 billion dollars in the use of 16 stadiums but equally important was the fact that they stacked their bid with Rich influential and well-connected people the head of the Russian bid was Igor chevalov the Russian Sports Minister and the president of the Russian Football Association was also heavily involved and that they brought in some of their oligarchs to help support it financially such as Abramovich what does that tell you it tells you we've got money we've got basically [ __ ] you money we can do what we like and they did ex-co-member Rafael salguero would later admit that he agreed to accept one million dollars for his vote from Russia and Jack Warner allegedly received 5 million for hits Russia was using the full weight of its government corporations and connections to win every layer of the vid process just as FIFA had designed it and they weren't the only ones the reason why I thought Qatar was always a possibility was this wasn't just about the World Cup for them it was the government saying this as an important step in their nation building so they really really wanted it and they had Deep Pockets at first glance qatar's bid was a long shot it's a fairly small country with a football team that's never qualified for the World Cup it was also too hot for football temperatures could reach 50 degrees in the summer and in 2010 Qatar only had one major city and one Stadium big enough for a World Cup game but what Qatar did have is some of the largest natural gas reserves in the world with an enormous amount of wealth all controlled by the country's Amir Hamad bin Khalifa altani and they were willing to use it to win the 2022 bit it pledged to spend an astonishing 200 billion dollars on infrastructure and build 12 brand new air-conditioned stadiums a bid other countries couldn't match and they didn't forget about xco British journalists would later allege that a qatari-owned company paid Warner around 2 million dollars for his vote there's also allegations that Qatar made payments to three other exco members but Russia and guitar's advantages went beyond wealth they were the only two authoritarian countries in the contest meaning they were Freer to work the shadier side of the bid you know the Australian World Cup that was very well funded as well but it was all publicly funded and every every scent was meant to be accounted for you know maybe you could move stuff around spreadsheets and so on but if you're going to engage in the dark arts you had to be very very careful whereas if you were coming from an authoritarian State like Russia or like Qatar you you can do what you like created a bidding process that would inevitably be won by the countries with the most cash and the least accountability and the thing is Russian Qatar got away with it but the scandals that followed nearly destroyed FIFA allegations emerged weeks after the 2010 vote but it wasn't until 2015 that the FBI arrested several FIFA officials in Zurich and launched investigations into Decades of FIFA's dealings even though no one's been put on trial for taking bribes from Qatar since the vote 13 of the 22x co-voters present that year have either been indicted or banned from FIFA at some point amidst these scandals ceplatter resigned in disgrace so in 2016 in an attempt to clean up its act FIFA gave congress the power to vote on World Cup hosts once again but the 2018 World Cup in Russia went on as planned generating record revenue for FIFA and Qatar is predicted to do the same are we comfortable wish the human rights record of Qatar and Russia are they comfortable with what Russia is doing at the moment that decision has been a great enabler for both those countries it's a decision that just doesn't stand the test of time at all they didn't get it right then and it's not right now foreign [Music]
