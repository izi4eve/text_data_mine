if you watch the news at all back in the summer of 2016 you probably remember stories like these the guy who is brash a guy who is blunt americans aren't willing to trust her don't think she's honest the news spent a lot of time dissecting the candidates personalities he's very forward and he's a little bit vicious analyzing their poll numbers closing the gap in states that matter most and psychoanalyzing their supporters these stories are part of a long tradition of political journalism where the goal is to make you feel like an insider someone with all the information on who's up who's down in which states with which groups and this kind of coverage basically treats an election like a big event sanders warren a competition a show and it's designed to make you feel smart as someone watching the election donald trump doing very well across the middle kind of like how knowing all the stats about a sports team makes you feel really smart when you're watching the game donald trump in july 80 million dollars by far his best month to date though that fell short of clinton's 90 million sometimes we make videos like that here at box but there's also another way that journalists can cover an election not as a show but as a choice between plans priorities and visions for what the country should do next this kind of coverage is designed to make you a smarter voter or if you don't live in the u.s to at least help you understand what this giant election is actually about that is what we want to make videos about between now and election day not about what's going to happen in the election but about what might change after it to explain that we want your help at the link below there's one question we want you to answer what do you think the candidates should be talking about that's it it could be a specific question like should we break up the big tech companies or why aren't more drugs legal why do american companies give so little parental leave should we have more nuclear energy or it could be a topic that's just been on your mind lately like what's the deal with the cost of college or what's going to happen with college or transportation or food security or paying for child care or student loans whatever it is tell us at the link below or at vox.com election videos what do you think the candidates should be talking about what's happening in your life that you wish they would pay attention to your ideas will become the list of things that we explain between now and election day then starting in september we'll put out one video every week each video will come from something you asked us for and if your question or suggestion inspired us we'll shout you out in that video this year and this election are not turning out how we thought they would the way we explained elections shouldn't stay the same either but first we need your help so thanks for watching and thanks for sticking with us
