this is it this is Tsarskoe v2 the novel coronavirus that first appeared in humans in late 2019 these are some of the first close-up views of the virus made using a very specific imaging technique that can see things far too small to be visible under normal microscope they show us how the virus moves inside the human body and how it hijacks our cells using these these spikey crowns give the karana virus its name and they're the key to understanding how to beat it to get this right I need to bring in two experts the first is my colleague Liz's dead Frank he teaches material science and engineering at Ohio State University this helps me that you are interested in electron microscopy yes so that's how you pronounce it okay that's a good start and the other is Beth Fischer her team at NIDA the National Institute of allergies and infectious diseases created those initial images of the virus the ones you'll start to notice imbedded in news articles around the internet I think for a lot of people there's a lot of mystery to this viruses there are two other viruses that emerge so let's start with how these images were made the first thing you need to know is that the corona virus is very very very small around 100 nanometers to put that into context if you take out a ruler and look at one of the millimeter markings you can fit 10,000 virus particles inside of that at that size it's invisible to us even under a standard light microscope like the one you might have used in grade school that's because the smallest wave lengths of light humans can see measure around 400 nanometers not small enough for the corona virus to be visible in order to see something that small you need an electron microscope how does it actually differ from what we would think of as a microscope instead of light we're using electrons and electrons you think of as particles but if you take the electrons trip it out for the atom and accelerate it in the field and make a climb fast if you make it move fast enough it actually will behave as a wave as well and that wavelength is much much smaller than the light waves we use in standard microscope now you're like six seven eight nine orders of magnitude smaller and size so now you can see smaller stuff if you look they're Knights coronavirus flicker page you'll come across two distinct types of images SEM and TEM they're made using two different types of electron microscopes a scanning electron microscope or SEM scans the surface of a sample and records what bounces back sort of like how satellite imaging works it gives you the basic topography of whatever you're looking at with realistic lighting similar to photography shadow and relative size of objects shows you their placement and how they move through the cell a transmission electron microscope or TEM goes way deeper it records the inner details of a sample by transmitting electrons through it and projecting a cross-section of its inner structure so it's part of the basic science research to try and understand structurally what's going on images from both microscopes are taken in black and white the color is added later for clarity like in this SEM image where virus particles colored in yellow are seen emerging from the surface of a cell colored blue and pink when examined together these images can help scientists start to figure out how the corona virus works there's ways to start then understanding how is it getting in a cell how is it harnessing that cell machinery to make more of itself can you just tell me kind of what we're looking at here so this is a single viral particle and the yellow you see it's the core of the virus itself and then the corona where corona viruses get their name and started that halo around it that's an orange that Corona is the key to understanding how the virus hijacks ourselves the Spike proteins that surround the virus attach to a host cell's membrane and then penetrate it once it forces its way in it spreads its RNA around the host cell multiplies exits and repeats which makes us sick so if we can find those two-bike proteins up with something like an antibody it'll prevent them from be able to attach and enter cells which is exactly how we've beaten back viruses with similar spiky proteins before this was a 3d rendering of the Ebola virus you see all those proteins on the surface so we talked about the spike that's what we're talking about no matter which virus were looking at this is HIV actually so this is printed after we do our cryo TEM and you can see all these little tiny proteins distributed on the surface and these are the proteins that we change a target for vaccine development you want to lock these up so they're tied up and unable them to stick to a cell surface is there anything about the images specifically that you'd want to share with our audience that maybe you think will be helpful for them to know I think when you can face your enemy it takes a little bit of the fear factor out of it I think it's just understanding what it is we're looking at how it works within our bodies but to show that this is something that can be tackled and overcome I think it's important to know [Music]
