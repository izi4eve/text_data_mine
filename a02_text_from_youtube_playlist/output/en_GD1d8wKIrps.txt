U.S President John F Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas Texas on November 22 1963. within hours of his death a gun was found in a nearby building and police arrested the accused killer Lee Harvey Oswald Oswald denied it I didn't shoot anybody he said somebody had set him up but when the Dallas Police searched his belongings they found these two photos of Oswald posing in his backyard holding the gun that killed the president the photos definitively linked Oswald to the murder weapon and made the case against him airtight in the minds of investigators but when they showed Oswald the photos he insisted they were fakes and that his head had been superimposed onto someone else's body frame him the next day Oswald was shot to death while in police custody sparking rumors that the US government was covering up the real story of the assassination and who else might be involved and this photo which has been scrutinized deconstructed and reconstructed ever since is at the heart of it after Kennedy's assassination government investigators spent 10 months compiling evidence and concluded that Oswald alone killed the president an explanation the public has doubted ever since conspiracy theorists argue that a powerful entity like the KGB CIA Mafia or Kennedy successor to the presidency had to be involved in such a high-profile murder and if these photos are fake it suggests a far-reaching conspiracy framed Oswald for a crime he said he didn't commit or at least didn't commit on his own this is the most notorious of the backyard photos it appeared on the cover of Life magazine in February 1964 and circulated in global newspapers people were quick to notice something odd the rifle on the cover of Life had a telescopic site and in other news outlets the scope was gone the news outlets explained they retouched the photo before Printing and inadvertently altered the appearance of the rifle but the controversy convinced people around the world the photo was fake and of course if it was fake now who faked didn't why did they fake it and opens up this whole can of worms this guy knows a lot about photo fakes my name is Hani Farid I'm a professor here at the University of California Berkeley and I specialize in digital imaging forensics I work on criminal cases on civil cases where the authenticity of an image or a video has been called into question to read is also the latest in a long line of experts that have used science to try to figure out if the photo of Lee Harvey Oswald is real oh that's amazing you have the original oh that's beautiful so what is the problem with this photo okay first of all I assume I can keep this there were four things that people consistently point to in the photo as purported evidence and manipulation first and foremost is people have argued that the lighting and the shadows in the photo are physically impossible in particular if you look on the ground there is this long Shadow to his right but if you look on his face the Shadow from his nose seems to be coming directly down so people were saying oh his head was spliced into a photo of somebody else holding the gun and the lighting was wrong that was number one number two is a if you look at Oswald in the photo he has this pretty bulky chin it's quite broad but if you look at his mug shots and other photos of him he seems to have this very tapered chin so that added to the evidence if you want to call it that that this isn't really his face that the chin seems to be too broad the contradictory shadows and the broad chin are the most commonly cited signs of alleged tampering this Theory even made its way into this scene in Oliver Stone's 1991 film JFK starring Gary Oldman as Oswald I never saw this picture that is my best but my face has been superimposed look at the way the Shadows on the nose fall in a straight line like it's High Noon a shadow down here on the ground reads more like late afternoon or early morning number three is that in the photo the gun seems to be shorter than the actual gun that was used to kill the president and then number four was that his posture seems odd it seems like he's sort of leaning back and he should be unstable holding that gun like that like so when you look at the photo yeah at first glance something looks a little weird there and so that's what has been around this photo for a long time [Music] in the 1960s and 1970s forensic experts tried just about everything to test the authenticity of this photo examined it at various exposures to check for signs of tampering didn't find any photograph the rifle that killed Kennedy at various distances and angles to compare it to the weapon in the backyard photo the dimensions matched side-by-side analysis with Oswald's mugshot confirmed it was him they also took photos with Oswald's seized camera to check if the unique artifacts specific to the negatives produced by that camera in this case these 11 scratch marks would appear across other photos they did meaning the backyard photos were taken with Oswald's camera investigators even recreated the photo numerous times to see if the shadow angles were possible in a single image most successfully in this one taken exactly four years after the original at the same hour in Oswald's former backyard the Shadows matched up straight down on the face and at an angle for the body they can included again and again that the backyard photos were taken with Oswald's camera and there were no signs of fakery but even presented with the facts the controversy surrounding the photo persisted and I think that is baked into conspiracies anything that is inconsistent with your core belief is simply evidence that that person is part of the conspiracy to keep information from you check out this mail order videotape fake made by famous conspiracy theorist and amateur photographer Jack D white who was obsessed with debunking the authenticity of this photo let me show you the results of my photo analysis and see if you too can detect the graphics blenders which prove that a powerful conspiracy resulted in the death of President Kennedy this guy was quoted in National media as an expert and in a 1978 BBC television documentary an actual forensics expert felt confident that one can only conclude that Oswald's head has been stuck onto a chin the flaw in these approaches is that people tend to overestimate their ability to determine real world physics from a single two-dimensional image and it turns out we're really really bad at it when it comes to certain things like Shadows like Reflections and mirrored surfaces but if you think about it that shouldn't be surprising this thing here the visual system didn't evolve over millions and millions of years to reason about a flat piece of paper so Farid and his team reconstructed the scene using 3D modeling software to rule out the four problems of the photo the Shadows the shape of the chin the length of the gun and the posture here's how they built it so we know a couple of things about Oswald we know how tall he was and what his weight was around the time that he was arrested so what you're seeing here is a three-dimensional model that has been scaled to his height in real world units they added Oswald's known weight to the model and posed it to match the stance in the photo adding the weight of the guns he's holding to test its balance Oswald's mugshot provided a reference for the narrow chin and shape of the nose finally they lit the scene with a single light source moving it around until the Shadows looked just right you can see how closely the 3D model matches the original photo in this overlay image it means that we have a three-dimensional model of Oswald and the Sun and the ground plane that is consistent with whatever was happening in that physical scene in 1963. now they could examine the Shadows he has this long Shadow down from his nose he has this long shadow cast back into his right and those are consistent with a single light source so it just turns out that Shadows sometimes look weird so what happens to that very tapered chin is it suddenly becomes very fat well why it's actually not the shape of his chin it's just a shadow so number two the chin of Oswald is consistent with what you see in the photo the gun which we know the measurement of is perfectly consistent with the photo there's nothing wrong with it it's exactly the right size and lastly the physics of the pose you are stable standing up when that Center of mass that projects straight down onto the floor is encompassed by your feet we have a 3D model of Oswald we know where his mass is we project that downward and what you see here is that it is well within the bounding area of the speed which means the pose with the gun and the weird backward tilt that he's doing is perfectly physically plausible some people might never let this photo go but ultimately the simplest explanation is usually the strongest I think you've got to start to ask how complicated is your explanation of what happened is it plausible that in 1963 somebody manipulated a photo to be fully consistent in a way that an analysis 50 years later cannot find evidence of manipulation I do not find that a compelling argument so when you start to chip away that any artifact in the image anything in the image that you think is evidence of tampering that we can start to now explain away at some point you get to the end and you say okay the only plausible explanation that is left is that the image is authentic and now you have to move on I talked to another scientist Pawan Sinha about light and shadows he's a professor of visual neuroscience at MIT and described a study he and his colleagues designed to test just how bad humans are at recognizing inconsistent Lighting in images the subjects were shown several pairs of Real World scenes one digitally altered to introduce lighting inconsistencies the other unaltered they were instructed to spot the original the test went like this two seconds for the first image a gray screen then two seconds for the second image people picked the right image only 50 of the time upping the view time to 5 Seconds increase that rate to 70 but the study concluded that humans just don't naturally recognize illumination and consistencies in images there's a link to the paper in the description of this video plus honey fareed's full study of the Oswald photo along with everything you need to read up on the investigations into this photo
