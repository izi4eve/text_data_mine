this piece by the marine band trio from hail america the marine band known as the president's own they play at the pleasure of the president and the commandant the marine corps and they've played at every inauguration since jefferson's [Music] greeting former president of epa dan quayle look at his eyes [Applause] [Music] ladies and gentlemen please be seated that's a phrase that is well welcomed right now let's enjoy the ceremony please welcome the honorable amy klobuchar [Applause] vice president pence mr president-elect madam vice president-elect members of congress and the judicial branch former presidents and first ladies vice presidents leaders from abroad and a whole bunch of bidens america welcome to the 59th presidential inauguration where in just a few moments joe biden and kamala harris will take their solemn oaths this ceremony is the culmination of 244 years of a democracy it is the moment when leaders brought to this stage by the will of the people promised to be faithful to our constitution to cherish it and defend it it is the moment when they become as we all should be guardians of our country have we become too jaded too accustomed to the ritual of the passing of the torch of democracy to truly appreciate what a blessing and a privilege it is to witness this moment i think not two weeks ago when an angry violent mob staged and insurrection and desecrated this temple of our democracy it awakened us to our responsibilities as americans this is the day when our democracy picks itself up brushes off the dust and does what america always does goes forward as a nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all this conveyance of a sacred trust between our leaders and our people takes place in front of this shining capital dome for a reason when abraham lincoln gave his first inaugural address in front of this capitol the dome was only partially constructed braced by ropes of steel he promised he would finish it he was criticized for spending funds on it during the civil war to those critics he replied if the people see the capital going on it is a sign we intend the union shall go on and it did and it will generations of americans gave their lives to preserve our republic in this place great legislation to protect civil rights and economic security and lead the world was debated and crafted under this dome dome now it falls on all of us not just the two leaders we are inaugurating today to take up the torch of our democracy not as a weapon of political arson but as an instrument for good we pledge today never to take our democracy for granted as we celebrate its remarkable strength we celebrate its resilience its grit we celebrate the ordinary people doing extraordinary things for our nation the doctors and nurses on the front line of this pandemic the officers in the capitol a new generation never giving up hope for justice we celebrate a new president joe biden who vows to restore the soul of america and cross the river of our divides to a higher plane and we celebrate our first african american first asian american and first woman vice president kamala harris who stands on the shoulders of so many on this platform who have forged the way to this day when she takes the oath of office little girls and boys across the world will know that anything and everything is possible and in the end that is america our democracy a country of so much good and today on these capital steps and before this glorious field of flags we rededicate ourselves to its cause thank you it is now my honor to introduce to you the senator who has worked with me and so many others to make this ceremony possible my friend and the chair of the inaugural committee missouri senator roy blunt well i should have known when senator klobuchar got involved at least there'd be a touch of snow up here this morning of all the things we'd considered i don't think snow was on my agenda until i walked out the door a moment ago but thank you senator klobuchar and thanks to the other members of the joint congressional committee on the inauguration as we officially begin the 59th inaugural ceremony i also want to thank the joint committee staff and our partners particularly our security partners for the they the way they've dealt with unprecedented circumstances when i chaired the inauguration four years ago i shared president reagan's 1981 description of this event as commonplace and miraculous commonplace because we've done it every four years since 1789 miraculous because we've done it every four years since 1789. americans have celebrated this moment during war during depression and now during pandemic once again all three branches of our government come together as the constitution envisions once again we renew our commitment to our determined democracy forging a more perfect union that theme for this inauguration are determined democracy forging a more perfect union was announced by the joint committee before the election with the belief that the united states can only fulfill its promise and set an example for others if we are always working to be better than we have been the constitution established that determined democracy with its first three words declaring the people as the source of the government the articles of confederation hadn't done that the magna carta hadn't done that only the constitution says the government exists because the people are the source of the reason it exists they immediately followed those first three words with the words to form a more perfect union the founders did not say to form a perfect union they did not claim that in our new country nothing would need to be improved fortunately they understood that always working to be better would be the hallmark of a great democracy the freedoms we have today the nation we have today is not here just because it happened uh and they aren't complete a great democracy working through the successes and failures of our history striving to be better than it had been and we are more than we have been and we are less than we hope to be the assault on our capital at this very place just two weeks ago reminds us that a government designed to balance and check itself is both fragile and resilient during the last year the pandemic challenged our free and open society and called for extraordinary determination and sacrifice and still challenges us today meeting that challenge head on have been and are health care workers scientists first responders essential frontline workers and so many others we depend on in so many ways today we come to this moment people all over the world as we're here are watching and we'll watch what we do here our government comes together the congress and the courts join the transition of executive responsibility one political party more pleased today and on every inaugural day than the other but this is not a moment of division it's a moment of unification a new administration begins and brings with it a new beginning and with that our great national debate goes forward and a determined democracy will continue to be essential in pursuit of a more perfect union and a better future for all americans what a privilege for me to join you today thank you i'm pleased to call to the podium a long time friend of the president-elect and his family father leo o'donovan to lead us in an invocation please stand if you are able and remain standing for the national anthem and the pledge to our flag thank you gracious and merciful god at this sacred time we come before you in need indeed on our knees but we come still more with hope and with our eyes raised anew to the vision of a more perfect union in our land a union of all our citizens to promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity we are a people of many races creeds and colors national backgrounds cultures and styles now far more numerous and on land much vaster than when archbishop john carroll wrote his prayer for the inauguration of george washington 232 years ago archbishop carroll prayed that you o creator of all would assist with your holy spirit of counsel and fortitude the president of these united states that his administration may be conducted in righteousness and be eminently useful to your people today we confess our past failures to live according to our vision of equality inclusion and freedom for all yet we resolutely commit still more now to renewing the vision to caring for one another in word and deed especially the least fortunate among us and so becoming a light for the world there is a power in each and every one of us that lives by turning to every other one of us a thrust of the spirit to cherish and care and stand by others and above all those most in need it is called love and its path is to give ever more of itself today it is called american patriotism born not of power and privilege but of care for the common good with malice toward none and with charity for all for our new president we beg of you the wisdom solomon sought when he knelt before you and prayed for an understanding heart so that i can govern your people and know the difference between right and wrong we trust in the counsel of the letter of james if any of you likes wisdom you should ask god who gives generously to all without finding fault and it will be given to you pope francis has reminded us how important it is to dream together by ourselves he wrote we risk seeing mirages things that are not there dreams on the other hand are built together be with us holy mystery of love as we dream together help us under our new president to reconcile the people of our land restore our dream and

this is america's day this is democracy's day a day of history and hope of renewal and resolve through a crucible for the ages america has been tested anew and america has risen to the challenge today we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate but of a cause the cause of democracy the people the will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded we've learned again that democracy is precious democracy is fragile at this hour my friends democracy has prevailed so now on this hallowed ground where just a few days ago violence sought to shake the capital's very foundation we come together as one nation under god indivisible to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries as we look ahead in our uniquely american way restless bold optimistic and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be i thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here today i thank them from the bottom of my heart and i know i know the resilience of our constitution and the strength the strength of our nation as does president carter who i spoke with last night who cannot be with us today but whom we salute for his lifetime in service i've just taken the sacred oath each of those patriots have taken the oath first sworn by george washington but the american story depends not on any one of us not on some of us but on all of us on we the people who seek a more perfect union this is a great nation we are good people and over the centuries through storm and strife in peace and in war we've come so far but we still have far to go we'll press forward with speed and urgency for we have much to do in this winter of peril and significant possibilities much to repair much to restore much to heal much to build and much to gain few people in our nation's history have been more challenged or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now once in a century virus that silently stalks the country has taken as many lives in one year as america lost in all of world war ii millions of jobs have been lost hundreds of thousands of businesses closed a cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us the dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer a cry for survival comes from planet itself a cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear and now a rise of political extremism white supremacy domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat [Applause] to overcome these challenges to restore the soul and secure the future of america requires so much more than words requires the most elusive of all things in a democracy unity unity in another january on new year's day in 1863 abraham lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation when he put pen to paper the president said and i quote if my name ever goes down into history it'll be for this act and my whole soul is in it my whole soul is in it today on this january day my whole soul is in this bringing america together uniting our people united in our nation and i ask every american to join me in this cause uniting to fight the foes we face anger resentment and hatred extremism lawlessness violence disease joblessness and hopelessness with unity we can do great things important things we can right wrongs we can put people to work in good jobs we can teach our children in safe schools we can overcome the deadly virus we can reward reward work and rebuild the middle class and make health care secure for all we can deliver racial justice and we can make america once again the leading force for good in the world i know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days i know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real but i also know they are not new our history has been a constant struggle between the american ideal that we're all are created equal and the harsh ugly reality that racism nativism fear demonization have long torn us apart the battle is perennial and victory is never assured through civil war the great depression world war 9 11 through struggle sacrifice and setbacks our better angels have always prevailed in each of these moments enough of us enough of us have come together to carry all of us forward and we can do that now history faith and reason show the way the way of unity we can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors we can treat each other with dignity and respect we can join forces stop the shouting and lower the temperature for without unity there is no peace only bitterness and fury no progress only exhausting outrage no nation only a state of chaos this is our historic moment of crisis and challenge and unity is the path forward and we must meet this moment as the united states of america if we do that i guarantee you we will not fail we have never ever ever ever failed in america we've acted together and so today at this time in this place let's start afresh all of us let's begin to listen to one another again hear one another see one another show respect to one another politics doesn't have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war and we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured my fellow americans we have to be different than this america has to be better than this and i believe america is so much better than this just look around here we stand in the shadow of the capitol dome as was mentioned earlier completed amid the civil war when the union itself was literally hanging in the balance yet we endured we prevailed here we stand looking out on the great mall where dr king spoke of his dream here we stand we're 108 years ago at another inaugural thousands of protesters tried to block brave women marching for the right to vote and today we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in american history elected to national office vice president kamala harris don't tell me things can't change here we stand across the potomac from arlington cemetery where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace and here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people to stop the work of our democracy to drive us from this sacred ground it did not happen it will never happen not today not tomorrow not ever not ever to all those who supported our campaign i'm humbled by the faith you've placed in us to all those who did not support us let me say this hear me out as we move forward take a measure of me and my heart if you still disagree so be it that's democracy that's america the right to dissent peaceably in the guard rails of our republic is perhaps this nation's greatest strength yet hear me clearly this agreement must not lead to disunion and i pledge this to you i will be a president for all americans all americans and i promise you i will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did [Applause] many centuries ago saint augustine a saint of my church wrote to the people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love defined by the common objects of their love what are the common objects we as americans love that define us as americans i think we know opportunity security liberty dignity respect honor and yes the truth recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson there is truth and there are lies lies told for power and for profit and each of us has a duty and a responsibility as citizens as americans and especially as leaders leaders who have pledged to honor our constitution and protect our nation to defend the truth and defeat the lies look i understand that many of my fellow americans view the future as fear and trepidation i understand they worry about their jobs i understand like my dad they lay a bed staring at the at night staring at the ceiling wondering can i keep my health care can i pay my mortgage thinking about their families about what comes next i promise you i get it but the answer is not to turn inward to retreat into competing factions distrusting those who don't look like look like you or worship the way you do or don't get their news from the same sources you do we must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue rural versus ireland or rural versus urban conservative versus liberal we can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts if we show a little tolerance and humility and if we're willing to stand in the other person's shoes as my mom would say just for a moment stand in their shoes because here's the thing about life there's no accounting for what fate will deal you some days when you need a hand there are other days when we're called to lend a hand that's how it has to be it's what we do for one another and if we are this way our country will be stronger more prosperous more ready for the future and we can still disagree my fellow americans and the work ahead of us we're going to need each other we need all our strength to preser to persevere through this dark winter we're entering what may be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus we must set aside politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation one nation and i promise you this as the bible says weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning we will get through this together together look folks all my colleagues i serve with in the house and the senate up here we all understand the world is watching watching all of us today so here's my message to those beyond our borders america has been tested and we've come out stronger for it we will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again not to meet yesterday's challenges but today's and tomorrow's challenges and will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example we'll be a strong and trusted partner for peace progress and security look you all know we've been through so much in this nation and my first act as president like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer remember all those who we lost in this past year to the pandemic those four hundred thousand fellow americans moms dads husbands wives sons daughters friends neighbors and co-workers we will honor them by becoming the people and the nation we know we can and should be so i ask you let's say a silent prayer for those who've lost their lives and those left behind and for our country amen folks this is a time of testing we face an attack under democracy and on truth a raging virus growing inequity the sting of systemic racism a climate in crisis america's role in the world any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways but the fact is we face them all at once presenting this nation with the one of the greatest responsibilities we've had now we're going to be tested are we going to step up all of us it's time for boldness for there's so much to do and this is certain i promise you we will be judged you and i by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era we will rise to the occasion is the question will we master this rare and difficult hour when we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world to our children i believe we must i'm sure you do as well i believe we will and when we do we'll write the next great chapter in the history of the united states of america the american story a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me it's called american anthem there's one verse that stands out at least for me and it goes like this the work and prayers of century have brought us to this day what shall be our legacy what will our children say let me know in my heart when my days are through america america i gave my best to you let's add let's us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our great nation if we do this then when our days are through our children and our children's children will save us they gave their best they did their duty they healed the broken land my fellow americans i closed the day where i began with the sacred oath before god and all of you i give you my word i will always level with you i will defend the constitution i'll defend our democracy i'll defend america and i'll give all all of you keep everything you i do in your service thinking not of power but of possibilities not a personal interest but the public good and together we shall write an american story of hope not fear of unity not division of light not darkness a story of decency and dignity love and healing greatness and goodness may this be the story that guides us the story that inspires us and the story that tells ages yet to come that we answer the call of history we met the moment democracy and hope truth and justice did not die in our watch but thrived that america secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world that is what we owe our forebearers one another and generation to follow so with purpose and resolve we turn to those tasks of our time sustained by faith driven by conviction and devoted to one another and the country we love with all our hearts may god bless america and may god protect our troops thank you [Applause] america ladies and gentlemen please be seated ladies and gentlemen please welcome garth brooks to perform amazing grace uh [Music] um how sweet the sound then saved her [Music] lost but now i'm found was blight but now i see [Music] when we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun we've known lesson days to sing god's praise then when we first begun i think ask you to sing this last verse with me not just the people here but the people at home that work as one united oh may sing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me [Music] i once was lost but now i'm found was blind but now i [Music] see foreign [Applause] hard not to be reminded of hard not to be reminded of president obama's singing that same song at the mother emanuel church a song that in our culture is as close to both poetry and prayer as you could possibly come and we're going to finish with those two things let me introduce amanda gorman our nation's first ever national poet laureate [Applause] mr president dr biden madam vice president mr imhof americans and the world when day comes we ask ourselves where can we find light in this never-ending shade the loss we carry a sea we must wade we've braved the belly of the beast we've learned that quiet isn't always peace in the norms and notions of what just is isn't always just is and yet the dawn is hours before we knew it somehow we do it somehow we've weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken but simply unfinished we the successors of a country in the time were a skinny black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president only to find herself reciting for one and yes we are far from polished far from pristine but that doesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect we are striving to forge our union with purpose to compose a country committed to all cultures colors characters and conditions of man and so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us we close the divide because we know to put our future first we must first put our differences aside we lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another we seek harm to none and harmony for all let the globe if nothing else say this is true that even as we grieved we grew that even as we hurt we hoped that even as we tired we tried that will forever be tied together victorious not because we will never again know defeat but because we will never again so division scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid if we're to live up to our own time then victory won't lie in the blade but in all the bridges we've made that is the promise to glade the hill we climb if only we dare it because being american is more than a pride we inherit it's the past we step into and how we repair it we've seen a forest that would shatter our nation rather than share it would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy and this effort very nearly succeeded but while democracy can be periodically delayed it can never be permanently defeated in this truth in this faith we trust for while we have our eyes on the future our history has its eyes on us this is the era of just redemption we feared it at its inception we did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour but within it we found the power to author a new chapter to offer hope and laughter to ourselves so while once we asked how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe now we assert how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us we will not march back to what was but move to what shall be a country that is bruised but whole benevolent but bold fierce and free we will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and an ursa will be the inheritance of the next generation our blunders become their burdens but one thing is certain if we merge mercy with mites into mites with rights then love becomes our legacy and change our children's birthright so let us leave behind a country better than one we were left with every breath my bronze pounded chest we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one we will rise from the gold-limbed hills of the west we will rise from the wind swept northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution we will rise from the lake rim cities of the midwestern states we will rise from the sun baked south we will rebuild reconcile and recover and every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful when day comes we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid the new dawn blooms as we free it for there was always light if only we're brave enough to see it if only we're brave enough to be it thank you amanda gorman now for our benediction i'm pleased to introduce reverend dr sylvester beeman the pastor of the bethel african methodist episcopal church in wilmington delaware a friend of president biden for 30 years as a nation and people of faith gathered in this historical moment let us

neighbors we will love the unlovable remove the stigma of the so-called untouchables we will care for our most vulnerable our children the elderly emotionally challenged and the poor we will seek rehabilitation beyond correction we'll extend opportunity to those locked out of opportunity we will make friends of our enemies we will make friends of our enemies people your people shall no longer raise up weapons against one another we will rather use our resources for the national good and become a beacon of life and good will to the world and neither shall we learn hatred anymore we'll lie down in peace and not make our neighbors afraid in you oh god we discover our humanity in our humanity we discover our commonness beyond the difference of color creed origin political party ideology geography and personal preferences will become greater stewards of your environment preserving the land reaping from it a sustainable harvest in securing its wonder and miracle-giving power for generations to come this is our benediction that from these hallowed grounds where slaves labored to build this shrine in citadel to liberty and democracy let us all acknowledge from the indigenous native american to those who recently received their citizenship from the african-american to those whose four parents came from europe and every corner of the globe from the wealthy to those struggling to make it from every human being regardless of their choices that this is our country as such teachers oh god as such teach us oh god to live in it love in it be healed in it and reconcile
