i'm on a bike ride in my neighborhood right now and i'm seeing some pretty beautiful clouds [Music] these are cumulus clouds when you're outside on a bright sunny day you might see hundreds of them like all clouds they're formed when water vapor in our atmosphere sticks to tiny particles of dust and salt and pollution floating around in the sky called aerosols when water vapor hits an aerosol it transforms into water droplets or ice crystals and when enough of those come together they form clouds every cloud is packed with information and knowing a bit about them can help you tell the difference between a cloud that'll disappear in a few minutes and one that could ruin your picnic to really know what's going on in a cloud you have to go right inside it that's what atmospheric scientists do i use satellite data aircraft data and even sometimes weather balloon data to understand these processes associated with clouds and precipitations that's dr myra oyola she's an atmospheric scientist who works at nasa's jet propulsion lab she's also very good at identifying clouds like those cumulus ones cumulus means heap in latin and you can kind of see why they look like big heaps of cotton i saw a bunch when i was on a bike ride in august these clouds are normally present when we have fair weather or good weather so it's a good day to go outside and play cumulus are one of the 10 most common cloud types which scientists started defining all the way back in 1802 there's also stratus which means layer they cover the sky like a blanket they vary in color so you can see some that they're all whiter but they can be grayish and they are normally associated with what we call fair weather our friend anna in michigan spotted some of those the weather today is nice and warm cirrus which means curl look like wisps of hair high in the sky my co-worker agnes found those above lake michigan in chicago cirrus clouds because they're so high they're very cold they're mostly ice very tiny particles of ice and they're short-lived and there's nimbus which means rain they're normally seen during a thunderstorm along thunder and lining these four basic cloud shapes combined with how high they are in the sky create the most common clouds like zero stratus clouds which exist above 7 000 meters they're kind of like pink sheets that spread across the sky these clouds are interesting because they tend to be useful to do weather forecasting in in the sense that they can tell you if there's precipitation or snow storm coming within 12 to 24 hours altostratus and autocumulus clouds hover a bit lower between 2000 and 7000 meters they often form a sheet like these fluffy autocumulus ones vox producer laura saw in maine if you see them in the morning this is a tip or weather forecasting what it means is that you need to be prepared because they are normally produced ahead of thunderstorms altostratus are less puffy more like one big blanket they normally thicken into being more type of rain bearing clouds like nimbus stratus if you see a low dark gray blanket of clouds you're probably looking at nimbo stratus and it's probably already raining like it was the other day in my backyard really coming down out here rain often comes from cumulonimbus clouds too they tower from close to the ground to really high in the sky they're not going to be your classical white puffy clouds they're probably going to be darker and grayish they're very distinct and very easy to identify when you look at this chart it seems pretty simple to tell the difference between these clouds but in reality it can get a little tricky for example look at this photo my friend jess took while canoeing these are definitely cumulus and serous clouds we know that cumulus are associated with fair weather however in this particular case i can probably tell that there was a storm before the picture was taken for the most part storms tend to expand all over the atmosphere so you have impacts of the storm really high up and cirrus clouds tend to be really high up in the atmosphere during sunrise or sunset it's pretty common to see a colorful mix of clouds in the sky it's very specific in the sunset because you obviously have a very sharp change in temperature going on at the time [Music] those 10 clouds we just talked about make up nearly all the clouds in the world but what about the ones that don't fit on this chart like here on top of mount fuji in japan mountain ranges and other high obstructions disrupt the normal flow of air as air moves over the mountains sinking air warms and rising air cools which creates these lenticular clouds they look like fluffy ufos extreme weather can bring unusual clouds all over the world imagine you're sitting outside and you start to see these bumpy baggy clouds roll in they're called momentous clouds and they usually come along with thunder lightning and rain or mostly composed of ice basically the ice falls and you have this pouches extending sometimes hundreds of miles in any direction ice crystals help create these weird clouds too called fall streak holes scientists think they're created when ice crystals in a cloud form really quickly and then either evaporate or sink to the ground so they leave this big hole around the center of the cloud some clouds don't even come from nature these are called contrails which just means condensation trails they're made of water vapor from a plane's exhaust and mimic nature's wispy cirrus clouds meaning they're high up and they disappear really quickly [Music] because clouds are above us we tend not to give them a second thought but they are super important because they not only regulate temperature on the planet but they're also the primary drivers of rain and precipitation which we need to live for us observers on the ground it takes practice to identify clouds a good tip is to have a cloud chart with a cloud chart it's very easy to at least distinguish the clouds that are at the bottom and the clouds that you normally tend to see at the top the clouds are on the middle layers are probably the most tricky ones there are lots of communities out there for cloud watchers like the cloud appreciation society which accepts submissions of clouds from all over the world and adds them to photo galleries online if you're ever stumped by a cloud it might help to look at it from above the national oceanic and atmospheric administration has a near real-time satellite view of clouds that you can access online when you combine all these tools together you can start making predictions about your day just based on the clouds above you i think that those clouds mean that it will be nice for the next couple of hours those big white wispy clouds up there mean that it's going to be nice the cloud chart we made for this video was super helpful when i was first learning how to identify clouds especially when it came to telling the difference between the basic ones like cirrus and stratus and cumulus to download and print out your own cloud chart like the one we use in the video get permission from your parent or guardian to go
