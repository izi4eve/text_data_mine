orange juice what did you say orange juice it's for one your feelings don't you worry about Suzy eating enough vitamin C many people reach straight for the orange juice when they get a cold or mix up one of these cold bus teen immune boosting supplements packed full of vitamin C it's supposed to help cure the common cold there are growing 200 million dollar industry and unsurprisingly their sales peak when the cold and flu season does and with boxes that claim that vitamin C helps support your immune system why wouldn't you pop a fizzy tablet when you start to feel a bit stuffy but if you follow this little asterisk you'll see that the claim isn't supported by the FDA that's because vitamin C doesn't cure your cold you really crave orange juice and that craving is your body wisdom by what you just can't beat that great tape you can trace the vitamin C craze back to this guy Linus Pauling he was a pretty big deal he won a Nobel Prize for his work with quantum chemistry and a Nobel Peace Prize in the 60s for his anti nuclear weapon advocacy so when he came out with a book in 1970 claiming that vitamin C could help you avoid colds and improve your health it took off Americans clear drug store shelves newspapers wrote that the sales were not to be sneezed at and called it the great cold rush but the medical community was cold to Pauline's cold claims for one they weren't based on any actual science Pauline had personally started taking vitamin C at the suggestion of a friend and he got less colds the criticism of course was that just because it happened to him it didn't make it a real study which Pauline admitted to and asked that someone actually do one but doctors already knew that taking large amounts of vitamin C wasn't the best idea adults only need 75 to 90 milligrams of vitamin C a day it's found in a ton of different foods most people are eating enough vitamin C in their normal diet for a healthy immune system but Pauline's book suggested taking 2,000 milligrams or more a day 22 times the amount you really need just because vitamin C is good for you doesn't mean that taking more is better for you a review of 46 different scientific trials with more than 11,000 participants found that taking vitamin C supplements regularly doesn't prevent you from getting colds it can reduce the length of your cold by a meager eight percent less than half a day but taking a supplement at the beginning of a cold doesn't make it go away faster vitamin C was found to be most useful for people engaged in intense physical exercise like marathon runners but for most people routine supplementation is not justified and taking extra vitamin C can result in a classic too much of a good thing that 2,000 milligrams Pauline recommended is the amount in two emergencies it's also the threshold of how much you can take before you may start to feel cramping or have diarrhea or nausea it could get worse a Swedish study found that men who took just a thousand milligrams of vitamin C a day or twice as likely to develop kidney stones but that's about as bad as it gets the reason this hasn't been more highly regulated is you can't seriously hurt yourself at vitamin C no one has ever died from an overdose Pauline himself said he used to take up to 30,000 milligrams it probably gave him tummy troubles but he was otherwise fine so what will help your cold for one hydration sure you can still have that orange juice but just plain water or clear broth will do the trick to things like decongestants ibuprofen vapor rubs they help ease the symptoms of a cold but they don't necessarily shorten it the best way to cure a cold is rest let your immune system do its thing and don't worry too much about vitamin C you you
