in 1888 the Eastman Kodak company rolled out a new camera and a new slogan you press the button we do the rest to say this moment revolutionized photography would be an understatement but this story isn't just about Kodak it's about what happens when a powerful technology originally only understood by a select few can suddenly fit in your [Music] hand the photography processes developed in the mid 1800s required a Mastery of chemistry timing and light to achieve a successful result becoming a photographer meant training on complicated equipment like big bulky cameras loaded with glass plates coated with photosensitive chemicals not to mention the expertise needed to develop images in a dark room once a photo was taken professionals set up shop in photography studios and offered their specialized skill set to a paying clientele getting your photo taken was often a pretty serious rare occasion that is until the Kodak number one debuted it was a handheld box camera pre-loaded with a relatively new lightweight invention roll film one roll in this camera could shoot 100 photos each cropped in a circle the results weren't nearly as sharp or detailed as professional equipment could produce but they were photos taken for the first time by people with little or no previous knowledge of Photography when you were done you mailed the whole thing off to Kodak and they mailed you back a camera with a freshly loaded roll of film in it ready to shoot along with your processed and printed photos this was just the beginning of people using photography to tell their personal stories they organized their printed Kodak photos into albums to document their travels and their daily lives at home people took portraits of each other but also candid Street Scenes the Casual nature of these photos made possible by how quickly the Kodak number one could take pictures showed natural smiles and people at ease in comparison to the portraits done in professional Studios up to this point which often had longer exposure times and a more formal setting codec photos came to be known by a word that up until this point was used in hunting and referred to a quick shot with a gun without aim at a fast moving Target the snapshot owning a codec number one would set you back $25 or the equivalent of more than $800 today so while photography was changing it was still well at of reach for most consumers the real breakthrough in amateur photography came a little more than a decade later when Kodak introduced the brownie a simple box camera made of cardboard encased in faux leather the brownie cost $1 in 1900 or about $38 today and whereas the codec number one was marketed toward the upper middle class the brownie at least at first was marketed toward children brownie users loaded their own role of codc film into the cameras which according to this Cod Kodak trade circular announcing the camera in February 1900 originally cost 15 cents each and were good for six square exposures and it wasn't just children using brownies once people realized these cheap point- and shoot cameras designed for kids actually took pretty good photos adults started carrying them around too and by the time the updated number two brownie came out in 1901 these handheld cameras were Everywhere by the end of 1905 more than 1.2 million cameras had been sold codc advertised relentlessly in the early 1900s branding their automatic cameras as crucial for capturing fleeting moments as lasting memories you could take a Kodak with you and the role of the camera as a record of one's personal travels and small moments at home that began with wealthy hobbyists in the late 1800s became Central to codex branding in the 20th century for over 100 years people have trusted their memories to Kodak film America Storyteller the company dominated the consumer level photo and film development market for over a century after its Kodak number one box camera came out but by the mid 9s a competitor from Japan Fujifilm had begun to eat away at the American photo giant market share including in the sale of cheap disposable cameras but that ultimately wasn't what pulled the plug on Kodak Supremacy in the film and photo industry the 4M Nikon pool piix 43 300 Sony sleer shot Canon Powers shot digital cameras by the early 2000s digital photography had outpaced film photography among consumers and kodak's relevance began to fade the first digital camera was actually invented by a Kodak engineer in 1975 but the company which from the beginning had built itself on selling and processing film rather than manufacturing cameras didn't make the change soon enough by the peak of the digital camera era in 2010 codc had fallen far behind in market share they filed for bankruptcy in 2012 later reemerging with a focus on digital printing services rather than film development of course film photography never fully died but the cost of film which now caters to a somewhat niche market of dedicated hobbyists keeps going up and with the days of the ubiquitous 1hour photo business now behind us amateurs without access to a dark room mail off their photos for processing just
