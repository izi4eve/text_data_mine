i think i was in sixth grade fifth grade seventh or eighth grade high school high school but that feels late to me i asked a bunch of my coworkers when they first had the talk not like the sex talk but the talk about how babies get made from a scientific perspective honestly for someone who just successfully gestated and delivered a human baby i know an embarrassingly little amount of like how my egg was fertilized even if we don't remember it super well we were likely taught it so how does fertilization work oh god okay sex happens after the ejaculation happens the little sperm swimmers kind of like do do do do do like mini numerous sperm it's a bunch of them swimming up there like going really fast [Music] and there there are so many that are like looking for the egg it's weird because i feel like you don't really hear about the egg the egg is very passive and just like fertilize me and like all the sperm is like the one doing all the work everyone i talked to told me similar stories that all had a lot of holes and it might be because of what's inside these [Music] right so it's often modeled off this fairy tale where you have the knight in shining armor going to save the damsel in distress i think most of us have heard some version of that story and it's just it's just not it's not true it's not factual nadia johnson and lisa campo engelstein co-wrote a paper about how the fertilization story were taught often centers on the male perspective in it they analyzed popular textbooks used from middle school's medical school keeping an eye out for gender biased language i ordered some of them on ebay [Music] this book describes only the sperm's role in fertilization 300 million sperm are released some are attacked and many simply die along the way only one sperm can fertilize an egg in other textbooks the female body's role is described using only passive language if an egg is present there's a good chance of it being fertilized or if an ovum is present the sperm swarm around it and penetrate those layers the books show the sperm actively swimming surviving and penetrating while the egg just sits there it's sending these really problematic messages about what it means to be male and female and who has agency and who is passive the truth is fertilization involves two equally important reproductive systems collaborating in an awesome two-player adventure real quick before we start there are different ways of making babies for different types of people in this video we'll be focusing on the fertilization story between male and female reproductive organs that story starts with the eggs journey beginning in the ovaries once a month during ovulation a mature egg bursts out of the ovary a finger-like membrane at the end of the fallopian tubes scoops that egg up and other membranes pull it towards the uterus it's a complicated necessary trip and for the best chance of fertilization millions of sperm enter the vaginal canal around the same time some go in the complete wrong direction and it's game over for them early on the ones that go in the right direction encounter a more acidic environment than they're used to that acidity in the vaginal canal can harm a few sperm but the seminal fluid they're ejaculated in acts as a sort of shield potion protecting them and while some textbooks describe parts of the female reproductive tract as a place that sperm never make it out of or are attacked by they don't talk about the ways in which the female body actually helps after the sperm travel through the vaginal canal they enter the cervix the environment of the cervix can be really helpful it enables the sperm to survive for a little bit longer and then it facilitates the migration of the sperm then sperm swim rigorously towards the egg but let's just say that they're not michael phelps it has this tail and you think oh this tail must be responsible for it's swimming from the cervix basically to the egg and we know now that most of the motility is because of the things that the uterus and the female reproductive tract is doing to move the sperm along first during ovulation the thickness of the fluid in the cervical canal is thinned out then the muscles of the uterus contract propelling the sperm faster than they could ever swim toward the fallopian tubes at the same time the egg is releasing a chemical signal that acts almost like a gps so that the sperm have a good indicator of which fallopian tube to go to there the egg and the sperm are almost within reach of each other the female reproductive tract releases a cocktail of protein and calcium which gives the sperm the strength to beat their tails harder and swim faster than they did before this fluid also helps the sperm weather away this little cap and once it's gone they secrete enzymes that help it dig through the two layers of the egg's protective outer shell i feel like every text we look at had the word penetrate we think of the word penetrate as neutral but think about when we use that language of penetrate we talk about forces penetrating the army lines if we think about war penetrate is this language of like an assault of doing harm penetrate is not a friendly like welcome in the egg doesn't just wait around to see which sperm will break through it uses chemicals to select the best sperm the one that will produce the healthiest offspring and its work doesn't just stop there once the egg and sperm come together the selected sperm deposits its genetic information the egg essentially self-destructs all of its other sperm receptors to make sure no other candidates can get in and it combines with the eggs to start forming what will soon be an embryo and that is how fertilization really happens so if this is the true story why have we been telling it another way for so long this idea of who decides and who the experts are in the field in science it's it's been white men for a very long time like the first person who ever saw sperm under a microscope was a man and he had assumptions about you know what it was if the assumption is that the sperm is the most important part of the whole puzzle it's not like that's gonna necessarily be challenged if all the people at the table are met eighty percent of all the textbooks lisa and nadia analyzed had descriptions that were at least somewhat gender biased it can be explained in a fact-based unbiased way but it you know it isn't always and until textbooks start explaining the fertilization story in a neutral way the information that gets transmitted to students will continue to be a mixed bag what we're talking about is not just changing language in a textbook what we're also talking about is systems that are in place and have been in place for a very long time you
