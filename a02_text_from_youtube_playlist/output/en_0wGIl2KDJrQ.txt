over 100 million farm- raised birds that's how many chickens turkeys and other poultry have died because of Aven flu in the United States since 2022 up until now most of us have only really seen the effects of this in our grocery bills but then on January 6th someone in Louisiana died it was the first reported human death from Aven flu in the United States which is pretty alarming but the tldr here is you don't actually have to panic so far there have only been 67 human cases in the United States and infections are typically very mild it's unlikely this will be another Co and maybe that's all you care to know that being said Aven flu isn't going anywhere anytime soon it's been found in every US state and on every continent except Australia public health experts are concerned because there is a chance this could get worse so what I wanted to know was this if we're not not worried now is there a point when we should [Music] be Aven flu viruses are naturally found in water fowl like geese or Ducks h5n1 the type of Aven flu circulating right now was first identified in geese in 1996 in China in 2020 a variant of that original strain was found in wild birds in Europe by late 2021 it was in the US and Canada typically a duck duck goose or other natural host shows no symptoms but can spread the virus through dropping saliva or mucus when an infected bird comes in contact with poultry is when we start to see disease and this is usually categorized in one of two ways the first is low pathogenicity which shows very little sign of illness maybe a chicken will lay less eggs or stop laying eggs altogether the second is high pathogenicity which is incredibly infectious and can result in 100% death rate you can guess which one we're currently dealing with when either version of Aven flu turns up on poultry Farms it has devastating effects farmers are often forced to call all animals to prevent further spread 4.2 million chickens on Iowa egg Farms as of last July 100,000 ducks on Long Island in January another million chickens in the United Kingdom the economic loss to Farmers is in the billions but over 100 million dead domesticated Birds later and the virus is still spreading the reason we're concerned now about this particular Aven flu is that it is uh spilling over more often than we see other Avan flu viruses too this particular Gene constellation seems to be um causing much more ability to spread across species barriers everybody I spoke to for this story really wanted to drive home this point this virus has affected an overwhelming diversity of animals experts are calling it panzootic a pandemic among animals it's been detected in nearly 500 species of birds worldwide including the endangered California condor and at least 70 species of mammals seals minks foxes it's killed sea lions by the thousands bears and pigs and dolphins otter ferrets and cats and most recently dairy cows which is weird and concerning for two main reasons one where it's being found in the cow influenza viruses for humans uh tends to be a respiratory pathogen this virus in particular it's replicating in a Mamon species in a tissue site that's not common for influenza Aven flu is being found in especially high levels in milk luckily pasteurization the simple process of heating milk before packaging it keeps consumers safe from exactly this sort of thing now the second problem is more obvious Aven flu in dairy cows brings Aven flu closer to humans but that is a bigger problem than a person just getting sick here's why the flu virus changes in two ways mutation and reassortment so mutation is sort of like what happens every year with seasonal flu viruses every year as the virus replicates in us the virus will change this is a new version of the same virus it just made a mistake while replicating itself reassortment on the other hand is when two different viruses meet in a cell and swap genetic material let's say this virus infected a human during flu season okay and you have sick kids at home and all of a sudden you also have human seasonal flu and you have this h5n1 because you work on a dairy farm now all of those genomes while distinct are related right they're all influenza and they can reassort or intermingle within that cell and generate new viruses reassortment of Avan flu resulted in two pandemics in 1957 and 1968 and reassortment of swine flu resulted in the 2009 swine flu pandemic reason we worried worry about that so much is that seasonal influenza viruses are epidemiologically very successful they spread so easily from person to [Music] person now what does it take for a virus to cause a pandemic you have to have a virus that is novel that infects humans and causes disease the population has to be susceptible the way we usually think about it it means that you don't have antibodies to that sub type but very importantly the virus has to be able to spread efficiently from person to person through sustained chains of community transmission this is generally what public health experts are on the lookout for and why monitoring this virus is really important so what the h5n1 viruses have are that they're novel they infect people they cause disease and the population is susceptible but they have not yet demonstrated the ability to spread spread efficiently from person to person if this virus starts spreading between humans then our problems have extended Beyond dead birds and egg prices luckily there are still a few other things on our side here for one the disease so far is mild in humans and two reassortment in humans is way less likely than it is in pigs or birds for some reason as for vaccines our seasonal flu shot is very specific so it's unlikely it will give us any immunity to this however previous exposure to the flu virus might give us a slight Edge the people that should be more concerned and more proactive are the ones that are in public health decision making and public health funding and so on the best we can do right now is be aware of what's Happening as it stands Aven flu is getting a lot of chances to change and become a bigger problem for humans we haven't stopped it yet I'm far less certain that we can put the genie back in the B well what a comforting way to end a video after telling you not to panic anyway I sincerely hope that this was helpful after 2 years of following the story and thinking of all the different ways I could cover it I ultimately just landed here a piece that tries to answer your biggest questions without freaking you out too much I've been at box for over 7 years and I've come to realize that I really try to answer two types of questions the dire ones that feel like they need answering right now and some that just spark curiosity turn to remind us that sure things are chaotic but the world is also wild and full of wonder if you like that mission and want to help you can join our membership program at vox.com
