you're looking at a chart of annual us drug overdose deaths going back to 1980 you can see it getting slightly worse almost every year then Rising more dramatically starting in the 9s mainly driven by overdoses on prescription opioids overdose deaths accelerate in a second wave through the 2000s and starting in 2013 a catastrophic third wave emerges kicked off by highly potent synthetic opioids like fenel but by the end of the TS the Fatal overdose epidemic in the US almost looked like it was starting to take a turn the annual number of deaths dropped for the first time since the crisis started but then stay at home that is the order tonight Corona virus emergency living in lockdown as daily life became more isolated us overdose deaths reached New Heights in 2021 the annual death toll from drug overdoses crossed the 100,000 Mark for the first time killing more Americans that year than firearms and fatal car crashes combined historically America's strategy for reducing drug use has been broad prohibition and criminalization of both selling and using drugs but you can see that criminalizing drug use hasn't stopped the overdose death rates upward Trend but gradually the US is starting to turn to different methods to fight the ongoing overdose epidemic and one of them is something you and I can do starting today over the last 10 years the most significant cause of fatal overdoses by far are cheaper stronger and widely distributed synthetic opioids namely fentanyl Alysa fentanyl is up to 50 times more potent than heroin and is often mixed into other drugs to make them stronger and more addictive the result is that it's often consumed unknowingly so if we look at overos deaths involving stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine you'll see that for years the number of documented fatal overdoses on these drugs consistently ran below 10,000 annually when fenel got mixed in starting around 2013 these deaths surged higher year after year Elissa fentanyl is also sold on the street disguised as less harmful prescription drugs like Xanax and Oxycodone which is thought to be the main reason why adolescents are now dying of opioid overdose at unprecedented [Music] levels opioids bind to specific receptors in our brain called op opid receptors and block pain messages between the brain and body they do this by numbing our central nervous system but opioids also numb our respiratory system they slow our breathing taking too many opioids slows breathing to dangerous levels or stops it completely which is why signs that an unresponsive person may be having an opioid overdose also called opioid poisoning include slow shallow breathing small pinpoint pupils and cold blue or pale skin but this entire process C can actually be reversed if help arrives soon enough the life-saving medication opioid overdose antidote an effective way to reverse an overdose this is nxone also known by the brand name Naran nxone has been in the toolkits of First Responders since the 2010s and ever since the FDA approved it to be sold over the counter in 2023 Noone is probably stocked in more places you go than you might think it's in coffee shops bars and restaurants and at public libraries spray bottles of Narcan are now kept inside overdose emergency kits in schools installed next to other emergency first aid equipment like heart defibrillators the way this nasal spray can reverse an opioid overdose is simple nxone is an opioid antagonist it binds to opioid receptors too but has an even stronger affinity for them than opioids do so it can dislodge opioids that are there already and block any more from binding to The receptors this process reverses and temporarily blocks the effect of opioids which is why people in the middle of an opioid overdose can be revived by nxone it's also harmless to use since all it does is block opioid receptors in the brain if no oxone is used on a person with no opioids in their system it does nothing at all and as more American workers who regularly interact with the public like restaurant servers and Transit officials train to use Naran in case of emergency some medical experts are urging everyone to carry nxone with them too now you might be watching this video and thinking okay well I don't use drugs so why would I carry no oxone there's substance use happening we don't have to pretend like it's not I don't know who's sitting around me who is managing themselves sh Walden is the executive director of the Kentucky harm reduction Coalition and she routinely hands out free Naran to bars and restaurants in Louisville Naran should be everywhere if I give a person a tool that can potentially prolong their life they're going to think about their decisions now is describing a strategy that has gained ground in the US in recent years harm reduction creating environments for people with substance use disorder to find support rather than punishing them we just say we know it's happening I don't want people to have to live with an unnecessary pain of losing someone that could have potentially been preventable what is the biggest obstacle right now standing in the way of reversing the overdose epidemic in the US I guess if I had to to uh pick one thing that makes this difficult to solve tomorrow it would be stigma Dr Bobby MCA is the chair of the American Medical association's substance use and Pain Care task force there's the legacy of that stigma that affects everything from law enforcement's approach to it to the community's approach to it to individuals willingness to deal with it we need to promote and facilitate the intersection of the use with the resources to help curb that use we cannot criminalize our way out of this epidemic we never been able to criminalize our way out of addressing substance use disorder accidental opioid overdoses especially in the era of fenal can happen anywhere one pre-pandemic study from the CDC found that in a 6-month period in 2019 almost 40% of fatal overdoses occurred with a bystander present we will run into strangers that are blue on the ground whether or not it's somebody we know or a stranger we want to be able to save that person's life I picked up this none kit for free from a nearby coffee shop it's got two doses of Naran plus instructions on how to use it and additional recovery resources inside if you live in the US there's probably overdose prevention resources nearby where you are too including in free vending machines being installed in cities across the country distributed by local harm reduction organizations and Municipal Public Health departments they also offer free trainings on how to recognize an overdose and how to administer Noone I'll put some helpful links for that in the description of this video expanding access to noock isn't a silver bullet for reversing the opioid overdose epidemic but it's saved tens of thousands of lives so far preliminary data from 2023 shows that overdose deaths in the US dropped for the first time since 2018 this overall drop was mainly driven by a decrease in deaths from fenel this tiny dip could be the beginning of reversing the overdose epidemic in the US and it's why I'm going to start carrying the lockone with me wherever I go because you just don't know when you'll come across someone in your Comm Community who needs help thanks for watching
