[Music] the perfect hero is someone who genuinely like doesn't really see it coming you want somebody who is open to change maybe a little uncomfortable with it that is a key is finding someone who is at that point in their life where they're ready you're kind of like the wizard of oz behind the curtains like you're making everything happen [Music] my name is danielle gervais and i'm the evp of casting and talent at itv america i've come up in unscripted television and moved over into um into casting through a series on abc called wife swap real lives real drama on this season i'll fix my family an all-new forged in fire was pawn stars one i saw that on your imdb we're casting the items and then certainly doubling back and make sure we've got good sellers good luck too with the emmys coming up as well [Music] how does it start from the second that you find out that there's going to be a new season what what is the first step that happens the first thing we need to do is determine you know where are we going once we identify the city we have obviously this is a team of people we'll sit down the initial war room and we'll say let's talk about what stories have we already told on the show what stories do we want to tell on this show we were trying to tell that story of reverend noah two seasons prior we just never found the reverend noah we never found it so that just happened our mission this week is to help noah take the past out of pastor and find faith in himself are we looking at like a day where you're like having lunch brought in and you're just hashing out literally every emotion and story that you could access i don't know if we brought lunch in but we had candy and snacks i know i remember that um there's always snacks we will also in that initial meeting pull in our partners at scout who are the creators of the show and that's where we really hash it out and we talk about like things like how political do we want to get because you also don't want to hammer people we never want to forget what was special about that initial iteration like a slob who's ready for a make better right so you've had your big war room meeting um you've decided on your location and some of the key themes that you're going to be exploring in that season what happens next the next thing is i have to figure out you know who's going to go to the city what are we going to do when we get there because we're not out there for very long we have budgets we'll immediately contact the film commission in that city they'll help us sort of steer to some degree you'll have two people hit the ground in the city with a plan of attack and you'll have usually a two people team back in the office with me doing all of the outreach you know remotely which is also huge so they'll meet people love them and go you gotta interview this guy so then the team back in the office will typically take that interview on so that the team on the ground can continue with their work we make little you know cute flyers and we walk around you gotta be pretty friendly to be in casting you really you're gonna be able to talk to anybody um and certainly there's people that are completely weirded out by it we'll see businesses that we want to hit a dog groomer and and lo and behold rihanna it comes out and she's you know six foot three with this incredible story i was asking one of my producers i was like what's your favorite story of finding someone we had a gentleman marcos who owned a fish shop they went to that fish market every single day because they just felt like there was such a vibrant like life to that place that it just was prime so they went every single day for two weeks and suddenly they peeked back behind like a um stand and they saw this fedora what's the obsession with that where did it come from marcos in mexico all the time we say hey compadre a little stalkerish at some times i'm not gonna lie i'd be remiss if i didn't ask if you were like secretly looking for people who clearly have incredible hidden bone structure it is always fun to say like especially if you've got like this big bearded guy who hasn't cut his hair and it's like what will he look like at the end of all of this [Music] from what you're saying it sounds like the casting will really flow from the story themes you want to emphasize rather than you find some person who just pops for some reason it is absolutely both it's rare that you're like here's the exact story you want to tell oh my god and this person is perfect and it like comes together kenny um who was in kansas city you know one of my favorite i love all of the episodes of course but he's one of my favorite heroes and the producer was at a bar watching a croatian soccer game and there he was his dog had passed away and he was a you know an older gentleman living alone and on paper you know there and then once it came to life he himself was such a lovable um rootable hero he's one you know he's one of my he's one of my favorites you've developed this list of good candidates with a combination of remote interviews and on the ground reporting is really what you have to call it what happens next in the process we pitch quite a few to netflix they have such vision and they support us and you know these interviews aren't always pretty right we're doing them via skype these aren't professional people in terms of being interviewed and they're nervous and so netflix is able to see through a lot um in that regard but a land on let's say eight heroes will probably pitch i mean internally we will look at frankly like hundreds um but in terms of the network you know we'll usually triple that number to show to netflix there are some where it's just like we all just go oh my god yes and then there are others where we can be split because it's all very subjective right what sort of diligence do you have to do when you're casting these people to make sure that they don't blow up in your face in a few months when the show comes out and somebody's killed somebody or done something terrible we won't even pitch anyone to netflix until we at least have done as much preliminary diligence as possible so we'll search lexisnexis and those types of things we'll do a pretty deep sweep on social media back about 10 years with some people you know that can be a deal breaker they are the secret sauce they are incredible and they um you know i can't say enough about how special bringing the five of them together has been it's been incredible but the heroes each one of those heroes serves as the foil to that episode right so they help anthony shine they help caramel shine like we have we sort of have a list where when we when we look at somebody as a potential hero we always want to keep those guys in mind you know what will they help bring out in our fab five and vice versa and so it sounds like when you're casting for this show in particular it's really about how well that these people will amplify the story themes that you're looking to drive home rather than are they good at sound bites my team is incredible they have a gift for really identifying like who who's gonna take the journey in a really authentic um way and who's in it for the free couch right because that's a thing [Music] are they authentic i mean at the end of the day we can we can teach people how to put the question back into the answer but you can't fake emotion and you can't fake somebody's journey you
