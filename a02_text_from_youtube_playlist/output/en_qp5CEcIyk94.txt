our bodies contain all sorts of microscopic organisms like bacteria and viruses some of these are pathogens that can cause disease animals bodies have them too when a pathogen jumps from one species to another species that isn't familiar with it it can exploit that new hosts lack of defenses and cause illness the pathogen that moves from animals to humans is called a zoonosis diseases like West Nile virus and Ebola both originated this way and researchers think covered 19 did too among humans the majority of new disease outbreaks are the result of zoonotic diseases and for the last few decades the number of zoonotic disease outbreaks has been increasing looking at this chart it might seem like humans are the victims of an onslaught of pathogens from animals but what if these outbreaks are increasing because of something humans are doing there's a lot of things we're doing that are increasing the probability of pandemic caused and pathogens emerging this is Sonia Shah she's a science journalist who writes about the history of pandemics right now we've used up over half of the terrestrial surface of the planet humans have been using more and more land for hundreds of years but that land use has accelerated in the last hundred years today satellite imagery shows us exactly what this expansion looks like we are expanding our cities erasing forests and reshaping the land for agriculture and sometimes that expansion is the result of war that's what happened here in West Africa it's an area that today includes Sierra Leone Guinea and Liberia there's a forest that once covered that area where the three countries meet throughout the 1990s civil wars in this region killed thousands and forced many more from their homes hundreds of thousands of refugees fled into that forest they cut down a lot of those trees they're making way for their homes and cutting down trees for charcoal and farming etc and you can actually see the change in the forest cover in satellite images if you look at the early 70s satellite images it's almost all green and then you look at late 1990s and it's mostly brown because only a small fraction of the original forests remained here in a village in Guinea is where researchers think an outbreak of Ebola began at the end of 2013 like the rest of the region this village used to be a forest and also happens to be a natural habitat for wild bats researchers believe the outbreak started with a boy named Emile who died after he was exposed to fluids from a bat carrying Ebola which quickly spread from his family to his village to other villages as humans develop and transform wild animal habitats events like the Ebola outbreak are becoming more and more likely we're paving over wildlife habitat which means it's much more likely that pathogens that live inside animal bodies will make their way into human bodies and that's because animals end up living much closer to us but in many cases those animals don't survive human encroachment into their habitats in the first place this chart shows the biggest extinction threats facing different animal groups for most of them the biggest threat to survival isn't pollution or being hunted it's the loss of their habitat and a disappearing species creates a different opportunity for zoonotic diseases to jump to humans take West Nile virus for example it originates in birds that migrate from Africa to North America in the summer it typically infects humans through mosquitoes but West Nile virus was never a problem in the u.s. until 1999 that's because we had a diversity of bird species in our domestic bird flu in a diverse bird population some species are good carriers of West Nile virus and some aren't North America once had a large population of birds like woodpeckers and rails that don't easily carry the virus that made it much harder for the virus to spread among the bird population but then we started disrupting those birds habitats what's happened over the past 50 years is we've lost a lot of that avian biodiversity woodpeckers and rails are now pretty rare what we now have instead are a lot of pieces like American robins and crows crows and Robins are much more adaptable to a changed environment but they also happen to be better carriers of West Nile virus the fewer web peckers and rails you have around and the more our robins and crows you have around the more West Nile virus you have around in your domestic bird flocks and the more likely it becomes that a mosquito will bite an infected bird and then by a human and that exactly what happened in New York City in 1999 before 1999 no one in the US had ever died from West Nile virus since then around a hundred and fifty people in the US have died from it every year the places where humans are encroaching on wildlife are the frontier for the next pandemic that means one thing scientists can do to prevent it is to watch those places really closely we don't know which microbe is gonna cause the next outbreak or pandemic but we do know how that happens and so we can really do active surveillance in those places where it's most likely to occur places where there's a lot of invasion of wildlife habitat but preventing future outbreaks might also require us to rethink our relationship with nature and to understand that as we take over more and more of the planet there's a cost to the animals that live there but also to us [Music] you [Music]
