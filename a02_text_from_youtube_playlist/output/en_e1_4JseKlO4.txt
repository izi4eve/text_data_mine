old city in the Amazon mr. Mendez but job death I didn't have Northwestern Brazil on the earth deep in the Amazon in December of 1988 the fate of the rainforest was changed by a murder in the small town of Sheppard II Chico Mendes was shot and killed serving Brazil's irreplaceable rainfalls and he paid for that apparently with his life two armed guards have been hired to protect him but they were inside his house when she Co was hit by a bullet in his backyard Chico had led the fight to protect the largest rainforest on the planet it was a fight that alerted the world to the exploitation of the Amazon and changed the makeup of the rainforest for decades to come [Music] the Amazon basin is rich in rubber trees that produce latex and for a long time they were exclusive to this rainforest native people had collected latex or liquid rubber for centuries but in the late 1800s after the Europeans turned their attention to it people started extracting latex on a mass scale it became a valuable material and rapidly industrializing nations where motorcars with rubber tires started hitting the roads the Amazon quickly turned into a very profitable global resource especially in Brazil where businessmen started moving into the rainforest to keep up with the high demand wealthy rubber barons forced indigenous people to work for them as rubber stoppers and they directed waves of migrants from the coast to the rainforest River Stoppers were forced to work in exchange for the use of the land tools or food so the more they worked the more they were in debt to their bosses but the rubber boom wouldn't last long in the 1870s an English colonist smuggled 70,000 rubber tree seeds out of the Amazon the seeds went from Brazil to British colonies in Southeast Asia where they began harvesting rubber at a lower cost over the years as rubber from these plantations flooded the market prices fell and the rubber boom in the Amazon collapsed but demand spiked again during the Second World War when rubber became critical to making weapons and vehicles and that rubber to fill the tank and not rubber to win the war the Brazilian government recruited tens of thousands and forced them to extract latex under harsh conditions after the war demand collapsed again and most rubber barons moved on to other businesses leaving many rubber tappers in the rainforest where they settled and were now free to harvest rubber on their own terms among them was Chico Mendes a young rubber tapper who started out working under rubber bosses who shook Willy Billy Dodd the assembly the aerials Kesey on Jesus a son really preposterous tratado we sitting this is Raimundo Mendez de barros Chico's cousin who works and lives on a reserve and Hawker estate I knew who she was time to step in and lead but come in the 70s and 80s when the Amazon began seeing deforestation at an unprecedented rate Chico Mendes and the rubber stoppers lived freely in the state of aquifers out a decade they harvested rubber and collected Brazil nuts sustainably without damaging the forests and made a living selling what they gathered two traveling merchants but there was a problem on the horizon at the time Brazil was led by a military regime that wanted to use the Amazon for economic development so they opened it up to ranchers for business they took over large estates typically occupied by rubber stoppers and cleared the forest to make room for their cattle the politics of land speculation and the large-scale deforestation that have as their objectives the substitution of man by cattle it would be a disaster if this process were allowed to continue in our region the ranchers used intimidation tactics to expel rubber tubber's they hired gunmen and set fires to tear down the trees but the rubber tappers got together and fought back they organized in bocce's or kids where they'd sit in front of trees or block the path to the rubber reserves to prevent loggers and bulldozers from coming through Chico an Raimundo or both on the front lines pathway formication taken control brah hetaera o spoonski Tahoe yes we'll settle this matter under identical Sugoi hunter all this male heir is Juan de Lucia Cebu I hate you who party a scream finish yah Lea I prefer introduce madam in protecting the rubber tappers way of life was at the heart of the struggle led by Chico but over the years it turned into a much bigger fight for survival the government backed by international organizations built roads in the Amazon which brought deforestation to different corners of the rainforest as a result by 1987 nearly 300,000 square kilometers of the rainforest had been torn down the fight to prevent deforestation extended throughout the Amazon and Chico became its spokesperson on a global stage [Applause] I'm a hernia poor soils mitotic gooses be large to the moon together we can preserve the forest and make it productive securing this immense treasure for the future of all our children began to pay attention every day it involves the destruction of one of Earth's greatest natural resources the Amazon rainforest the rainforest is unique in all the world once it is gone it is gone forever international organizations withdrew tens of millions of dollars from the development of the Amazon a small extraction reserve was created for rubber stoppers in Accra in 1988 the first of its kind in Brazil the land would be owned by the state but rubber stoppers like Raimundo would have the right to live and work on it look as if he feared L am an ice-cold Fed one well no I noticed him with the reserve would keep everyone else out especially cattle ranchers making this entire reserve legally protected from deforestation but in 1988 protecting the rainforest came at a deadly cost 89 environmental activists were killed that year alone I've already escaped six attempts on my life from the enemy though I have a moral commitment to myself I cannot abandon the struggle even if one day I should be struck by an assassin's bullet cattle ranchers looking to expand their business in the Amazon saw Chico as a threat he was given armed guards for protection but just days after his 44th birthday he was shot in his backyard his killers were cattle ranchers a father and a son whose land had just become a protected area Yasu revolted the trees or the mother God when 82nd division two

extractive reserves have been created there are more than a hundred spread throughout the Amazon but the fight isn't over Brazil's current government has pushed for more economic development in the Amazon while downplaying she costs they've also scaled back efforts to preserve the Amazon leaving protected areas at risk all over again nearly half of the deforestation is taking place in protected
