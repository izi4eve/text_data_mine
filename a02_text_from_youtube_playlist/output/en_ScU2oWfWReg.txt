[Music] for black women the story of voting rights is a long one very early on at the dawn of the 19th century they are already at work on a political philosophy that decries racism and sexism in american politics but constitutionally speaking it begins with the 15th amendment because black women also need race to be an impermissible criteria if they're to get to the polls sojourner truth is a name people might know the former slave anti-slavery activist and women's rights activist francis ellen watkins harper poet anti-slavery lecturer we also have figures like nanny helen burrows id wells was another major activist that people don't necessarily associate with the suffrage movement but she absolutely was black women never find a very comfortable home in women's suffrage associations racism is always present sometimes in very pronounced ways we have pictures of parades marches women dressed up in sort of late 19th early 20th century victorian gear hats large hats carrying signs about votes for women and most of these images are of white women the key figures are a remarkable duo of women elizabeth katie stanton and susan b anthony and those two women will take us to the 19th amendment in august of 1920 the state of tennessee will by a mere one vote ratify the 19th amendment an amendment that prohibits the states from using sex as a criteria for voting and it will become part of the constitution and american women win the right to vote so for white woman it was the end of a long fight but for many black women it was just the beginning of an uphill battle to exercise those rights african-american women are aware but really everyone is aware that nothing in the 19th amendment is going to prohibit individual states from continuing to disenfranchise black voters and so the first election that they had after the bill passed the white women were going to vote and we'd just step and went to vote and when we got on there well we couldn't vote they gave us all different kind of excuses why we just stayed we stayed we asked we wanted to know why we couldn't vote and the answers to the questions were so invalid we were not satisfied so finally one woman mrs simmons said are you saying that we can't vote because we're negros and he said yes negroes don't vote in primary in texas so that just hurt our hearts real bad and so the 19th amendment even as we mark this anniversary it leaves many many american women to continue the struggle for political rights including the vote and african-american women are one chapter or one facet of that story there's nothing in the 19th amendment that guarantees chinese immigrant women the vote there's nothing in the 19th amendment that guarantees to native american women the vote latinx women particularly mexican-american women also occupy an ambiguous place in the story of voting rights for black women the right to vote is symbolic and that's not to diminish symbolism it's to say that the right to vote is a sign that they are full and equal citizens of the united states african-american women are facing the challenges of racial violence lynching and access to the polls african-american women are looking at a range of inequalities economic inequalities housing inequalities health inequalities educational inequalities and access to the ballot is a lever in those struggles it is the gateway to sitting on juries it is the gateway to office holding black women have an agenda and it is an ambitious one and one that they hope the vote will help them further it wasn't easy to try to get people to come out to go and try to register to vote because the first time that we went we had a circle around the courthouse of pickup trucks and rifles and white people getting ready to stop us only four people got in that whole day what did the white people have to fear from somebody blacks registering if they became a registered voter many of the blacks would seek positions in the political field they would be out they would fight for justice if they were registered voters they would turn the city completely around and that is the reason why they did not want to see black people become registered voters what black women want in the wake of the 19th amendment is federal legislation that will now protect their voting rights to impose on those states with a history of disenfranchising black voters an extra requirement and black women will wage a campaign that will take them all the way to 1965 and passage of the voting rights act in that year it's important to say that winning the voting rights act is a brutal brutal campaign black americans women and men put their lives on the line in too many southern jurisdictions in order to force the hand of congress to force the hand of lyndon johnson to win voting rights legislation this is not an easy road for african-american women it is a harrowing road but it is indeed a victory one that black women had been looking for for nearly half a century [Music] i know that my grandmother raised my mother that they always had to vote like it was something that she was born in my grandmother susie jones her portrait hangs on the wall and i am very accountable to her even as she passed many years ago people ask me why do we need to know this history today we live in an era of voter suppression laws that are neutral on their face voter id requirements or the purging of voter rolls or the shuttering of polling places none of which announce that they are aimed at keeping voters of color women of color from the polls but when we look at those laws in practice we can recognize that like in 1920 in 2020 seemingly neutral laws are being used to disproportionately keep people of color away from the polls by running for political office and affecting change on the ground in their communities and in their states so we now have black women running for governorships and we have a number of african-americans that we've seen has shaped elections so i think the idea of enfranchisement is also expanded to not just being able to vote but exercising political power and exercising political agency and i think that's the legacy of the suffrage movement to me these are not women who dropped out of the sky these are women who come out of a political tradition and are building upon that and will tell you that if you ask them these women and the generations that followed worked to make democracy and opportunity real in the lives of all of us who followed you
