countries around the world have shut down to curb the spread of the corona virus but in South Korea people are starting to come back out on the streets starting in late February South Korea was reporting a sharp increase in coronavirus cases with over 5,000 infected they were registering some of the highest numbers of confirmed cases in the world but then something changed while cases in most other countries continued to rise korea's numbers started leveling off look at how this curve starts to bend it indicates that Korea managed to contain the spread of the virus early on and they were able to do it because they learned a valuable lesson a few years ago when they fought a different coronavirus outbreak in South Korea the Middle East respiratory center the death toll on the rise of ggressive Lee trying to contain the deadly outbreak the government was caught completely off guard authorities are still trying to track down and isolate anyone who may have been exposed in 2015 a Korean businessman returning from the Middle East developed a fever a cough and eventually pneumonia he went to several health facilities for a diagnosis before finally testing positive for MERS or Middle East respiratory syndrome caused by a corona virus by that point his movements had created a chain of transmission that became hard for officials to trace they didn't know who was infected or where they had been it lasts less than two months it was a big penny in South Korea altogether the virus-infected 186 people and killed 38 in South Korea the highest of anywhere outside of the Middle East the government declared an end to the outbreak in 2015 citizens can relax the virus no longer poses a threat but they didn't stop planning we got many resting on the importance of the divers tests and we need basic infection cremation majors the lessons all came into play when the next outbreak took hold in the country on December 31st 2019 China reported the first case of the corona virus in the following weeks as the outbreak started spreading across the world South Korea only had 30 confirmed cases of the virus but despite the low numbers health authorities had already started working with biotech companies to develop a test for the novel coronavirus and soon they had thousands of test kits ready to go lesson learned from while suffering in 2015 first one is the thymus test is very essential we developed a lot of targeted and distribute in every hospital they prepared for the worst and the worst quickly followed by late February the total number of coronavirus cases rose dramatically crossing 3,000 this made South Korea's outbreak the largest outside of mainland China and it all started here in big where a woman went to the hospital with a fever because the government had already equipped hospitals with coronavirus tests doctors were able to test her she tested positive and became known as patient 31 but the testing didn't stop there while she was sick patient 31 had gone to a megachurch where she sat with a congregation of hundreds for more than an hour so they traced her movements identified people she had come into contact with and then tested those people as well whether they showed symptoms or not many of them also tested positive so they were quickly isolated and treated at home or at a center and then all the people they had been in contact with were traced and tested too this is called contact tracing it's an approach that allowed Korea to test over 9,000 people who had been in contact with someone who had tested positive after Daegu Korea ramped up testing around the country private and national health care systems joined forces to set up a mostly free testing effort that includes more than 600 locations could screen as many as 20,000 people per day through this system when anyone test positive the government is able to test and trace their contacts to continue to break the transmission chains of the corona virus on a large scale but that's just the human to human transmission the infected person may have moved through the city touching subway poles and door handles and South Korea had prepared for this - after the MERS outbreak when they weren't able to trace the movements of the virus Korea changed the law allowing the government to collect a patient's data and security footage during an outbreak all their steps are logged and then shared to alert people to stay away from the path of infection if there is some confirmed case found near my office they message by a smartphone there is a confirmed case near your place he pushes websites and private apps compile that information allowing everyone to see a person with a confirmed case of coronavirus went to a pharmacy or the hospital or anywhere else and they'll know how recently they went to it's a means of checking the possibility of infection citizens are checking the coronavirus locations and are avoiding going to these areas this information lets people know if they've crossed paths with an infected person so they can go get tested for the virus and contact tracing starts all over again tracing people's every move can be controversial but many in South Korea prioritize Public Health over privacy in an outbreak as a result South Korea was able to test hundreds of thousands of people more than any other country at the time and this made it easier for authorities to see the virus to see where it's located and where it may be lurking this ability to find and treat infected people has allowed Korea to avoid aggressive lockdowns and it's helped bend the curve of the outbreak that started out dangerously steep for now Korea has turned a corner but they continue to be prepared we are very cautious to prevent secondly every day is kind of a takeover wall it's that kind of vigilance but a set Korea apart in the corona virus pandemic but it wasn't the only place to test people aggressively Singapore Taiwan and other neighbors so the benefits of widespread testing - now countries like Germany and the UK are starting to implement aggressive testing and even the US where the government has failed to provide adequate testing is now scrambling to test more people we know that we have to do more and we continue to accelerate and testing Korea strategy of contact tracing might not be easy to replicate in countries with much larger populations but the country's success with widespread testing still offers a way out for most countries that are stuck in locked [Music]
