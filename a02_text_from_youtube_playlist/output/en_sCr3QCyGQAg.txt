worked there you go hi there this is chip davis i'm in nebraska right now it's like 65 degrees not a cloud in the sky i got all my windows open today chip is most well known for his musical group mannheim steamroller which has made dozens of chart-topping christmas albums but in the 1970s he was known for something completely different chip was right out of college living in nebraska and writing commercial jingles for an advertising agency my clients they were like black and decker drills and greyhound bus and continental and i wrote somewhere in the vicinity of 2000 jingles and he wasn't that plugged into the world of pop music i didn't really know what some of the styles were i remember the first time i got asked to write some r b i didn't even know what r b stood for i thought that was a restaurant in downtown omaha when i was with the ad agency i said all right any type of music but don't ask me direct country because i don't know anything about it this is where things get interesting by 1976 his country song was number one on the billboard charts like holy cow how'd that happen this song is what happened this here's a rubber duck you got a copy on me big fan come on this is convoy a song chip davis produced with his writing partner bill freeze a creative director at the ad agency he worked for its lyrics captured a fictional conversation between two truck drivers across cb radio and it was wildly popular probably the largest record that i created it was the number one song in the us and canada and charted across europe it was so huge that hollywood made an entire film based on it i mean it was it was a big deal it's a strange song to listen to 45 years later to many its lyrics might not even make sense what's a bear in the air or a suicide jockey why is he called rubber duck but this song is a time capsule from a brief era when truck drivers were full heroes and the country music that soundtracked their lives topped the charts this is the story of trucker country country music has always dealt with sort of issues of wanderlust and travel that's nate gibson he's a country music scholar those sort of played out in the in the 30s and 40s through imagery of the western frontier cowboy imagery and train songs there have always been labor songs about american occupational heroes we we have lumbermen railroad men [Music] but as travel and work shifted to roads and automobiles so did the characters country music focused on truck drivers became country's new folk heroes the first trucker hit in 1939 was cliff brunner doing truck drivers blues [Music] throughout the 40s there are scattered remnants of truck songs that sort of cut through the masses but things changed dramatically in 1956 when president eisenhower unveiled a plan to revamp the interstate highway system this is the american dream of freedom on wheels an automotive age traveling on time-saving super highways these interconnected highways allowed people to travel long distances more easily and it created thousands of new jobs especially in the long-haul trucking industry and with that a new market for country music opened up truckers spent the majority of their day and night staring down an open highway it was a lonely profession and often the only entertainment they had was the music at roadside cafes when you went to a truck stop you could always play songs on the jukebox and the music on the radio it's important to know they're really two major types of radio stations in the united states at in the 1960s and 70s that's travis steimling he's a country music scholar there are am stations that can only broadcast during the daytime and then their am stations that can broadcast overnight these nighttime stations were really unique because they had such little signal interference they could travel much longer distances than your typical radio range they would cater often to the truck drivers who were on the road uh you know all night long and they would play these songs songs about having pride and being a trucker or these weepers about being away from your family and really just all sorts of country music there's a flame farmer you have six days on the road a massive hit by dave dudley my home towns are coming in if you think i'm a happy you're right six days on the road and am i gonna make it home tonight it draws a lot of what we call the bakersfield sound and this is really twangy country music with electric instruments telecaster guitars lots of high frequency sounds sharp attacks on the notes it's the kind of music that could keep you awake if you were driving a long-haul trip across the country six days on the road climbed to number two on the country charts right alongside johnny cash's classic ring of fire and buck owens act naturally and it kicked off what many music scholars consider the golden age of trucker country music six days i would consider the golden age of trucker country between 1963 and 1966 not only were individual artists releasing singles and albums but record labels were making compilation albums centered around the trucking theme especially star day records they put out their first trucker specific album in 1963 and it sold so well that every artist who came into the studio after that they would say hey this session's great but can you add a country music song about truck driving to that this time period saw the release of classic trucker songs like tombstone every mile if they buried all the truckers lost in them woods there'd be a tombstone every mile roll truck roll [Music] tons of steel and if you were paying attention to the lyrics you might have noticed something many of these songs were real downers red sovine this guy was an artist known for dialing up the sadness factor to attend they called him the syrup sopper because he was promoted by a syrup company on the hayride but also his songs were so syrupy and sad and he did these recitations about finding his long lost son on the highway and he lost track of him that's the story line of his first big trucker hit giddyup go we got to talking shop and i said how'd you come by the name on your truck giddy up go [Music] well he said i got it from my pop and then the next song there's a school bus in the middle of the road and a trucker drives off a cliff to avoid hitting the school bus full of children on its side well joe lost control went into his skin and gave his life to save that bunch of kids and there at that crossroads was the end of a line for big joe and phantom 309 there's something about like the the cab of a truck being almost a safe place to express yourself and these songs just hit every possible raw nerve truckers weren't totally alone in their cabs though they had another special form of radio where they could connect with each other the cb citizens ban radio was a form of short-range radio that was adopted by truck drivers as their industry grew in the 1960s it was like a pre-internet public chat room with its own insider lingo for example you didn't go by your own name but a made-up handle my dad had a handle he was known as the pumper because he worked in the oil rigs pumped oil my godfather was known as michelob because that was his favorite beer in this book the big dummy's guide to cb radio the author explains that truckers use the cb to communicate important things like traffic good places to eat and where to park their rig at night citizen band radio was the great connector along u.s highways but in 1973 truckers harnessed the cb in a way they hadn't before and in doing so became an inspiration for a new era of trucker country music the oil producing countries of the arab world decided to use their oil as a political weapon the oil ban will continue against the united states and the netherlands because of their strong support of israel in 1973 war broke out between israel and a coalition of arab countries and after the u.s provided military support to israel arab countries retaliated by holding back oil supplies the president said that all will have to cooperate everybody is to have to do some sacrificing the resulting oil shortage affected nearly every aspect of american life but it was truck drivers who were really hit hard nixon signed a federal law lowering all national highway speed limits to 55 miles per hour it is now essential that we have mandatory and full compliance with this important step on a nationwide basis having had enough truckers devised a plan to protest on the highways they am asked convoys of semi-trucks which caused traffic jams that went on for miles and shut down some interstates completely the protective convoy was to move at 50 miles an hour with 500 feet between trucks and a five-car police escort the fact that so many truckers managed to come together was a feat on its own and they pulled this off all thanks to the cb radio my riding partner bill had a cb radio he was listening on this cb radio to all of this stuff going on with the truckers going down interstate 80 and he said man it sounds like a war going on there fascinated by the lingo bill and chips started to form an idea we went about you know listening to it and like thought that's a song i bet we could turn that into something i started it with the military drum kings breaker breaker there one night this here's a rubber duck you got a copy on me big fan come on that's phil he adopted the stage name cw mccall you want to put that microbus in behind that suicide jockey yeah he's home dynamite and he needs all the help he can hear and if you don't know what that is the next line tells you that guy's hauling dynamite a suicide jockey somebody's hauling explosives or something that if you were in an accident the accident wouldn't kill you the explosion would that's the thing about these stories the way bill wrote the lyrics was that they're so engaging you could really picture it convoys struck a nerve and it topped the charts in 1976.
it also inspired dozens of more songs that use the cb radio as a storytelling device [Music] in the 70s you sort of establish your authenticity and your credibility in song by being able to rattle off the cb lingo a year after convoy was released none other than the syrup sopper himself released what is now considered one of the saddest country music songs ever and he used the cb radio to tell it the old cb was blaring away on channel one nine when there came a little boy's voice on the radio line it's about a kid who's bound to a wheelchair his dad was a truck driver but he died that had a wreck about a month ago he was trying to get home in a blind and snow and so he inherited his dad's cb and talks to other truckers spoiler alert all the truckers take the off ramp into his community and give him rides in the trucks this is this weeper of a song and every time i listen to it i just bawl like a baby the cb becomes the the mechanism through which the story's told country music and really all pop music is always looking for a gimmick and and the cb i think provided a good one uh for a few years convoy was a song that pushed trucker and cb radio culture into the mainstream but it wasn't something totally new it tapped into a long history of songs about working class life i think trucker country represents a concerted effort on the part of some songwriters to capture the emotional experience of people who are doing a working-class job and that's something that goes way back into kind of the deep roots of american folk [Music] music [Music] you
