inside the American Museum of Natural History in New York is this enormous iron meteorite it crashed into Earth here in Northwest Greenland around 10,000 years ago as a piece of space debris and for centuries was used to make metal tipped tools and weapons by a small tribe of indigenous greenlanders the inquit until an American Explorer seeking fame and fortune dragged it across the Arctic and sailed it to New York to sell to the museum but this giant piece of iron isn't the only thing brought here on that ship in 1897 six inquit came too after being told they'd return home to the Arctic within the year rich with weapons and tools if they agreed to be studied by the museum most of them wouldn't make it back it's a story of false promises big Ambitions and one small boy who would grow up to challenge the Museum that took everything from him for centuries of human history pretty much the only way to get iron was if it crashed into Earth from space in the form of meteorites like here where 19 iron pieces including this dagger were found in Tuten Common's tomb which was sealed centuries before smelting technology developed in Egypt ancient Egyptians even had a hieroglyphic symbol for meteoric iron which translates literally to metal of the sky indigenous groups in this part of the world were used using meteoric iron to like the inquit sometimes called polar Inu who make up the northernmost band of Inu the ancestors of the Ino first came to this part of Greenland around 1,000 ad and the Chance existence of meteoric iron here was a crucial part of making this region inhabitable for humans at all this area north of the Arctic Circle has always been harsh and extremely remote but the little Ice Age which spanned from the 15th through early 19th century froze ocean access to this region making it even harder to reach the inquit lived in Virtual isolation for centuries until an expedition led by British Explorer John Ross arrived in 1818 and came ashore when he saw the iron tipped knives Spears and harpoons Ross assumed at first that the metal must have washed up from a shipwreck until the inquit told him it came from a nearby Mountain Ross guessed that this Iron Mountain must be a crashed iron meteorite bad weather prevent to the Expedition from finding the Iron Mountain which Ross later described as the most important mineral production of this country this was the beginning of an increase in trade with European explorers as Northern Expeditions continued here throughout the 1800s several of which tried to find the meteorite but never could by the 1890s the inquit had become accustomed to trading with foreign ships for manufactured goods metal tools and weapons and relied Less on the meteorite as their sole source of iron which is how an American Explorer hungry for Fame and Fortune Justified his decision to take it at this time the Foreigner the inquit interacted with the most was this man Robert Peri he had come to this remote part of Northwest Greenland with one goal in mind reaching the North Pole Peri was part of an era of European and American exploration in the late 19th century obsessed with the parts of the map not yet reached by white people and in the case of the North and South Pole not known to have been reached by hum at all he's considered to be the first non-inuit to study greenlandic Inuit culture and survival methods and throughout his years of exploring the Arctic funded by his wealthy family and by groups like The National Geographic society and Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences now known as the Brooklyn Museum the Inuit taught Peri how to survive Arctic conditions and how to travel over the ice using sled dogs they also worked as expert guides Hunters Dog Handlers and laborers during his Arctic Expeditions from a tra TR perspective the relationship was beneficial to the Ino but it was much more enriching for Peri while the Ino got resources like guns household items and metal tools from Peri Peri got Furs and ivory from the Ino which along with other cultural artifacts he would bring back to New York and sell to support his efforts to reach the North Pole when Pi's 1894 Arctic Expedition failed he knew he had to come home with something to keep his backers interested and he knew from stories going back to John Ross in 1818 that the inquit had access to a rare iron meteorite maybe a big one so in exchange for a gun to an Inman who said he knew the location of the Iron Mountain Peri was led right to it a lot of this history has been lost to time but what historians do know is that Peri didn't ask permission for what he did [Music] next after a mostly inquit crew excavated two fragments of the meteorite found here and dragged them to per ship using rope and wood rollers Peri learned of a third much larger fragment on this nearby Island too heavy to take on his ship it would take multiple attempts over the next couple of years returning to Greenland with a much bigger ship and specialized equipment including heavy duty Jacks and even a custombuilt railway to excavate and then drag this largest meteorite across the Arctic landscape to the edge of the island and finally load the most expensive resource Peri ever extracted from the Arctic onto his ship Bound for New York careful to frame his interactions with the Inu as nothing but good-hearted and without coercion or exploitation per orchestrated a few images about his removal of the tribe's local source of iron by staging this scene recreating the as he put it ancient practice of mining the meteorite for metal and captioning this photo of the inquit who moved it for him as a farewell to the savic saw the meteorite who Peri later wrote happily did all they could to put into my possession the Iron Mountain of their forefathers but the meteorite wasn't all Peri took from the tribe to impress his backers in New York because an assistant curator for the American Museum of Natural History had asked a special request of Peri that he bring back in a Nook to be studied at the Museum per convinced six inquit to come with him a respected Hunter and key provider in the tribe named nutak who brought his wife atanga and their 12-year-old daughter aak a young man named Wisa kasak and kisuk a another skilled Hunter who lost his wife to an epidemic brought on by one of Pi's earlier Expeditions who brought with him his seven-year-old son manik per didn't just promise to compensate the group handsomely for their Journey he also assured them they'd be taken care of by the museum for their entire stay in New York but that's not what happened when per ship with the giant meteorite and six inquit on board arrived in the Brooklyn Navy yard in October 1897 it stirred up a lot of excitement 20,000 people paid to board the ship and see the people and meteorite Peri had brought back which he pocketed to fund his further Expeditions and then left on a lecture tour promoting his latest thrilling adventures in Greenland leaving the inquit in New York to be studied at the American Museum of Natural History where they were initially forced to live in a damp hot basement inside the museum within days of exposure to the warmer climate and with no immunity from American diseases they were all hospitalized with respiratory infections mik's father kisuk was the first to Die the museum told Minik they buried kisuk but that wasn't true kook's body was dissected and his remains were stored inside the museum for further study photos of his brain appeared in this 1901 scientific report soon after kook's death atangana nukak and their daughter aak died of disease too and Wisa kasak asked to be sent back to Greenland which left only manck alone and the only ino in all of New York City by 1899 just 9 years old manic had lost all contact with peri at this point the Explorer never came back for the people he convinced to come to New York and sold their meteorites to the museum for $40,000 an equivalent of more than a million dollar today it took a few years for the museum to find a way to remove the meteorite from the Brooklyn Navy Yard which they finally did in 1905 before and just like in the Arctic carefully dragged it through the streets of New York on wood rollers and then a giant truck pulled by a team of horses all the way to the American Museum of Natural History where it became a Prestige item and major attraction for the museum there's no record that Peri ever shared the fortune he got from the meteorite with manck the boy he brought to the museum and then abandoned after his father died manck was taken in by a museum official named William Wallace and grew up in New York City under Wallace's care he forgot his native language Eno tun and started going by the name man Wallace eventually his foster family fell on hard times and now impoverished a teenaged manik started asking questions about his father kisuk and though it's somewhat unclear how discovered the truth that the officials from the museum had lied to him and his father's body had been desecrated without mik's knowledge and was inside the museum supposedly in the name of science starting in 1907 mck took to newspapers to tell his story and publicly pleaded that the museum return his father's remains so he could give him a proper burial they ignored him the following year he called on Peri to help him leave New York and send him to his home in Greenland Peri said there was no room on his ship at least not until 1909 when there was suddenly a spot for manck on one of Pi's ships Bound for Greenland it was right around the time Peri claimed that his recent Arctic Expedition was the first to reach the North Pole and manck was writing in American newspapers about how Peri treated his people when he was a boy including taking the meteorite which Peri put aboard his steamer and took from my poor people I can never forgive Peri and I hope to see him to show him the wreck he has caused a few months before per returned to the US from his final Arctic Expedition manck was on a ship back to Greenland before manic left he wrote the biggest regret he had about leaving America that I must return home alone leaving the body of my father who was taken from me a martyr to the coldblooded scientific study of your people when manck got home to Greenland he needed to relearn his native language and inquit Customs like hunting kaying and dog handling he'd only been around 7 years old when Peri took him to the US after all he eventually returned to the US in 1916 working as a lumberjack in New Hampshire he died there 2 years later one of the millions of victims of the 1918 pandemic the museum never answered his repeated calls to return his father's remains they kept the bodies of all four of the inquit who died in their care for almost a century until New appeals were made by author Ken Harper who had published give me my father's body a deeply researched book about manck in 1986 the museum finally gave in to mounting pressure and returned the remains of kisuk nikak atangana and a to Greenland in 1993 when we reached out to the American Museum of Natural History for comment they acknowledged that their role in ki bringing Manic and the five other inquit to New York in 1897 included a series of unethical and unjustifiable actions especially the morally abhorent Act of misleading manik and refusing to return his father's remains only in October 2023 did the museum finally began to reckon with the more than 12,000 human remains it kept going back to the 1800s and committed to removing all human remains from its display cases but the meteorite Peri took is still there it remains a signature exhibit of the American Museum of Natural History which the museum has described as the largest meteorite in captivity a plaque displayed in front of the meteorite includes a passing mention that it was brought to the museum by American Explorer Robert Peri but nowhere in this room will you find a mention or a photo of manik or kisuk or any of the six people that Peri left at the Museum
