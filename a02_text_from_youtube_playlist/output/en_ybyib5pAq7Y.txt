oh oh damn [Music] oh these people are panicking because they're being asked to step out of an elevator onto a single plank that's suspended 80 stories in the air oh man this game is called richie's plank experience and by their very real reactions you might expect some groundbreaking photorealistic visuals behind that headset but that's not the case sure it's nice but it's clearly not real the graphics are beautiful but the lighting isn't quite right things are just a little too diffused the buildings are almost too smooth and the plants on the ground are clearly squared off it's hard to believe these people aren't dramatizing their reactions for the camera oh god but it's not just a plank experience the internet is full of vr fails where people are sucked into pixelated worlds with disembodied parts in front of them and this really got me thinking how is it that a virtual world that doesn't look very real at all feels so real of course the first major difference between watching vr and being in it is putting on the headset here's where vr marketing has mostly failed right because it's always shown from a spectator's perspective and as a spectator you do not get the experience of the person in vr thong win is the founder and ceo of romera a company that helps businesses test and understand new spaces before they're built using virtual reality vr communicates to your brain in a different way than looking at a screen when looking at a screen like our tv or phone our brains read this as a flat image the same way it would a picture if an object on a screen gets bigger or smaller or the person on tv moves towards the camera you don't feel the need to take a step back or move out of their way but in vr you might want to because you're not looking at one screen you're looking at two and those two screens are literally right in front of your eyes projecting a slightly different image into each eye which is how our vision works in the real world each eye takes in stimuli from a slightly different vantage point you can test this hold your finger up in front of your face and wink each of your eyes your finger should jump back and forth that jump is the difference between what your left and right eye are seeing and the difference is between what your eyes see conveys depth it conveys three dimensions this is known as stereopsis and vr developers have spent a lot of time perfecting it but what uses depth if you can't move through it which brings us to the next most important way virtual reality tricks your brain you are the camera and it's fast enough where your brain starts interpreting it as your perspective head tracking allows a person in vr to look and move around a fake world in the same way that we look and move around a real one if you look to the left you'll see more of the world to your left and if you look down [Music] okay maybe don't look down other subtle effects make virtual spaces feel more real like 360 audio which is a big part of the plank experience as you turn your head the wind will subtly change the plank creaks and if you listen closely a heartbeat slowly begins to speed up our brain takes all this new virtual stimuli and begins to believe this is reality our brain has never really learned within the last 150 000 years to actually distinguish between computer-generated content and the real world dr frank steinica has been studying immersive technologies like vr for nearly 20 years and if all the cues that we perceive in the virtual environment are so similar to the cues that we get in the real world it is makes kinds of sense that we are unable to clearly distinguish between both our brains quickly adapt to virtual environments largely because it's wired to trust our sense of sight there's some research showing that approximately 80 of all the information that we perceive from our environment are based on vision and this allows vr developers to manipulate our reality even further we found out about 10 years ago is that we if we guide users on a circular arc with a radius of 20 meters they have no chance to identify that they actually walk on a circle in the real world when they see a straight path in the virtual environment you can walk an entire virtual city without ever leaving a room once we believe the environment is real and accept that we're actually in it our brains then go on to fill in some other blanks there is interesting findings that for example if you are in the virtual world in a very let's say snow or icy environment people feel cold yeah although they're in the real world in a maybe in a hot environment outside of games vr has actually shown a lot of promise in the medical world from reducing pain and burn victims by immersing them in a snowy world while their bandages are being changed and with exposure therapy that helps people with phobias like a fear of heights and body dysmorphia it's also being used for physical therapy like assisting elderly people with their balance right now we're still tethered to a system with a headset on our faces the graphics are nice but not perfect and so we're not fully immersed when we hover 80 stories above the ground that is we can still remember to take the headset off seneca cautions that it might not always be that way we can easily assume that within the next five to ten years or so we will not be able to distinguish visually computer generated content from from real world content anymore and then of course there are a lot of ethical questions for now vr might not look exactly like reality but it follows a lot of the rules our brain has learned to perceive as real and that's often enough to make a sweat [Music] you
