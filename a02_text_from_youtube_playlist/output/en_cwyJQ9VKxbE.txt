back in 2017 Paris mayor and hialgo reinforced one thing in the city's final push to host the 2024 Summer Olympics that its famous river the sen would be a key fixture of the games including an historic Olympics opening ceremony the first held outside of a stadium for which French officials initially said there is no plan B and that Open Water Swimming events would be held in it it's not hard to see why the S runs along some of paris's most famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and notam the thing is swimming has been banned in the s for a century and that's because the river sen has human in [Music] it like many Urban waterways around the world the S takes on sewage overflow during heavy rain when the city's underground sewer systems get overwhelmed with STM water hiago even said she would take a swim in the sen herself ahead of the games French president Emanuel macron promised the same thing they say they're confident because of an enormous underground infrastructure project they've built near the river to ensure as much as possible that it won't on their parade this isn't the first time Olympic Open Water Swimming events the triathlon paratriathlon and Marathon swimming were at risk of being canceled last minute due to water quality issues we saw some of the same headlines during the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo and the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in both cases they pulled it off and Paris hopes to do the same but the journey to clean up the S hasn't come without a few setbacks a preliminary event in the river scheduled for August 2023 was cancelled when Water Analysis showed an unacceptable amount of eoli in the water ecol are bacteria that originate in the intestinal tracts of warm-blooded animals presence of them in water is a strong indicator of recent feal contamination which can make you very very very sick in order for an Open Water Swim event to be given the go-ahead Water Analysis reports must be submitted no more than 48 hours prior to competition those samples cannot exceed more than 1,000 cfu Colony forming units of eoli per 100 mL of water and 400 cfu of okaki another bacteria associated with feces test results published Just 4 months ahead of the games showed that River samples taken at this bridge the site of Open Water Swimming events still failed to get under that crucial 1,000 number for permissible levels of ecoli you can see where this contamination is coming from by taking a look at this 1852 map showing how the original Paris sewer system was built it dumps right into the S which is gross but it's not a problem that's unique to Paris many Urban sewer systems work this way before I get into that though I want to tell you about the sponsor of today's video better help I don't know about you but this year feels like it has flown by and I can't believe we're halfway through the summer already therapy is a great way to ground yourself in the present and help you set achievable goals for your mental health for

Paris did installed what's known as a combined sewer system in a combined sewer system the same pipes that handle waste water also handle storm water which gets collected through storm drains in the Street everything gets sent along to be processed at water treatment facilities and then Cycles out to the natural environment when it rains a lot the sewers can get to full when this happens rather than flooding back into the street the excess combined waste water and storm water gets partially redirected to a nearby Waterway which is why ecoli levels in water can Spike dramatically in the hours following heavy rain it's because that water was recently contaminated with so you'll see signs near combined sewer outfalls that prohibit swimming swimming after Heavy Rain if that happens during the Olympics it could mean canceling Open Water Swimming events so Paris built a giant tank this 13.2 million gallon capacity underground reservoir and tunnel is part of a$ 1.5 billion US infrastructure project that aims to clean up the S it's called The alwoods Basin built near the alets metro station right by the senent with the tunnel running under the river to the sewers French officials open the Basin Less Than 3 months ahead of the Olympics opening ceremony which is scheduled for July 26th I'll let this guy explain how it [Music] [Music] works basically the system will hold excess water so the sewers don't get overwhelmed in a rainstorm and then it will methodically release the water back through the sewer system giant reservoirs like this have worked in other cities with big populations like the thoron composite Reservoir outside of Chicago which can hold nearly 8 billion gallons of Wastewater and this combines SE outflow facility in the parat Basin in New York designed to prevent contamination of the Basin and nearby Jamaica Bay the osto Basin isn't designed to clean the SC that's an ongoing multi-prong process this project was built to prevent further and sudden contamination of the sen from combined sewer overflow the goal according to French officials is to resort to opening the sewer overflow Gates that dump into the sen no more than twice a year compared to the current rate of 10 to 15 times per year Paris will continue testing as the Olympics rapidly approach but Hidalgo and mcon have yet to swim in the S even if all goes perfectly according to plan a significant rainstorm could still contaminate the sand forcing Open Water Swimming events to be [Music] postponed the idea of making the sand swimmable again goes beyond just the 2024 Olympic Games it seems to be a good thing to start last in this annual race through Paris because the river s gets so full you could almost walk over the swimmers in front it brings the city back to a time when the river was a place for parisians to cool off in the summer instead of a biohazard once the Olympics are over that becomes the next phase of this project according to Mayor Aon hadalo three swimming sites in the sen will open to the general public in 2025 thanks to the games as for the plan to host the opening ceremony along the S French president Emanuel macron has now said that there are backup plans if the security risk is too high whether or not Open Water swimming will be possible can only be determined hours before the events and will be at the mercy of rain meaning making the scense swimmable in time for the Olympics is going to take a lot of work and a lot of luck
