before a tennis player makes a serve they have to get in the zone Novak jokovic will bounce the ball first with his racket then with his hand Naomi Osaka will tap her thigh raile onad doll will pull his shorts the sleeve around his shoulders touch his nose and then finally move his hair to the back of his ears but there's one ritual almost every player does they're looking at the fluff choosing a tennis ball with the perfect level of fluffiness is a long-held tennis tradition and some players believe the right ball can help them win but does fluff actually make a difference in a professional tennis match six balls are used over nine games before serving players typically ask the ball boy or girl for three or four balls and select one or two and most of these players are looking for something specific try to to get the ball that is more new for the first surf denil meddev is a professional tennis player who's currently ranked number two in the world he's defeated Novak jokovic Rafael Nadal and Dominic team he just competed in the ultimate tennis Showdown and the French Open and he cares about fluff try to to find the ball that has less hair actually because we go faster in there you don't want this big ball you know that has a lot of humidity in it for the first s because it's not going to go fast Michael Costa a former professional tennis player does the same thing I would always want the more compact tighter felt ball for my first serve I felt like that move faster through the air it gave me more confidence to hit that first serve and I would save the kind of juicier bigger fluffier ball for my second serve as like almost a safety ball I need this big slow beach ball to get in the court in just in case I miss my first serve second serve they looking for control more than speed my name is Patrick morto I'm a professional tennis coach I'm working with Serena Williams for the last almost 10 years yes the Serena Williams when the bull is fast you have less control so on the second sh they don't want to hit a double fult and the fluffier the ball the more grip you have it's kind of tactics it's I should say it doesn't affect so much like you're not going to win the match just because you you chose a fluffer Ball but there is some science behind this ritual so Robbie how involved or how much information do you know about tennis uh I think I know enough to be dangerous in in terms of the science I'm I'm not I'm a pretty lousy tennis player Dr rabindra works for the NASA as Research Center and has been studying the aerodynamics of sports balls for more than four decades the the fluff is the whole key with tennis you get what we call extra drag drag is the force that slows the ball down as it's flying through the air initially when you pull it out of a can you'll find it's pretty Compact and so has a one level of drag on it but when you start playing with it it tends to fluff up initially the first few games and the drag actually goes up like the hair on our arms it'll contribute to the drag that's why swimmers have their own ritual of Shaving all their body hair before big meets to make it easier for them to move through the water to figure out how much the fluffiness of a ball actually affects its speed Dr mat and his team used a wind tunnel so we had the ball on the balance so we could measure how much drag Force how does it change they compare tennis balls with different amounts of wear and prove that the fuzzier the ball the slower it moves and uh the way we proved that was to start literally shaving the the ball to try and get it to match the other balls and we were able to do that on the court this drag can mean that if a player serves with a fluffier ball the person receiving gets slightly more time to react and the server then gets slightly more time to return it I was at the US Open and we had some people there who were interested in what we were doing and they actually sent us balls that had been used in the actual tournament and so when we started looking at those balls it was pretty obvious that they were preferentially using two or three balls out of the six so it wasn't like there was equal wear beyond the science the ball selection still serves a purpose if I believe when I match point down and I have to hit a second serve that my rituals of finding that bigger juicier Fier ball are going to give me a tiny little bit of safety on the second serve that little that little bit of confidence can be what helps you eek out the match there is such an incredible amount of pressure and stress on them so the fact that it makes them feel better make them play better that's why routines are such a big part of the sport the the goal of the routine is to refocus for the next point and it becomes a habit some routines can be more obsessive than others like Nadal mously lining up his water bottles on the sidelines I don't think he even knows is doing it anymore he's done it for so long but for many that little ritual of picking the right ball is enough most of the brothers choose their balls Serena doesn't by the way she's one of the only players who does not she's taking only one ball to serve one by one so if she misses a first sh then she asks for a second ball where most of the players take two balls keep one in their pockets and then and she takes the first ball that comes she never ask for another goal
