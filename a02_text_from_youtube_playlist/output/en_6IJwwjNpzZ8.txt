these people are in line to vote early in Philadelphia nothing unusual about that except these voters had already voted they cast their ballots by mail but they were missing one thing an accurate handwritten date the lawsuit that got these ballots thrown out was filed by the Republican National Committee it's part of a larger effort led by allies of former president Donald Trump many of whom ran for election in the 2022 midterms in the news you'll often hear this group referred to as election deniers and while it's true they do still deny that Joe Biden won in 2020. what they can do is just as important as what they say in 2020 nearly three quarters of U.S voters cast their ballots early or by mail but these politicians want to limit and even get rid of these practices altogether this plan is what motivated thousands of volunteers across the country ahead of the 2022 midterms they didn't just fight election deniers in a lot of places they beat them and how they did it could be the key to protecting free fair and open elections in the U.S for years to come let's take another look at those mail-in ballots in Philadelphia on Monday I got like 15 calls and like 10 text messages from a variety of like volunteers and like political people about my ballot the day before the election I got a text from a friend like thousands of other voters in Pennsylvania Kristen and Zoe had already verified their identities by providing a Pennsylvania issued ID number when they applied for their mail-in balance their ballots had been postmarked and stamped by the Philadelphia Board of Elections on the day they were received and yet these lists came out that list people who would sit in a mail-in ballot that was invalid for some reason your name showed up I was like disappointed myself for a second I'm like how did I date this incorrectly like I really thought I was following all the you know the rules and what the guidelines are to have how to fill it out Pennsylvania has had mail-in voting since 2019 and in every election since then multiple judges have ruled that missing date should not mean a ballot gets thrown out but just weeks before the last day to vote in 2022 a group of Republican politicians sued to try to get a different ruling and it worked the candidate at the top of the ticket for Republicans gubernatorial Canada Doug mastriano was like noted election denier I am the elections director for the Mid-Atlantic region For the Working Families party I'm a proud resident of Philadelphia Pennsylvania the greatest city in the world we knew that there was a risk that people would use mail-in voting specifically as a way of attacking the legitimacy of the elections overall we ended up with over 1300 unique volunteers who are calling voters to help them cure ballots and make sure their voices were heard Doug mastriano lost his bid for governor and and Democrats now control the Pennsylvania state house if enough State reps want to change that rule about the handwritten dates on the outside of envelopes they can like mastriano in Pennsylvania one of the candidates for Governor in Michigan Tudor Dixon had also cast doubt on the 2020 election results more than half the state's 5.5 million votes in 2020 were cast by mail and even though Republicans in the state senate authored a report that found no evidence of widespread or systemic fraud that didn't stop Tudor Dixon from tweeting about stolen elections and it didn't stop the republican-led state legislature from introducing 39 bills to dramatically limit mail-in and early voting there are many many reasons why people would want to vote by absentee ballot but for some reason some politicians want to make it harder Kim's organization voters not politicians recruited more than 300 volunteers and knocked down over a hundred thousand doors I remember on Election Day I woke up at about six o'clock in the morning I went all up and down my street I really want to talk to you today about prop 2 is going to give us all the constitutional rights about without harassment or interference included by our own legislators it's going to give us all nine days of true early in-person voting if you rode through Detroit you will see this area especially where I live it was covered with prop 2 PSI Yes on Prop 2. you're going to be able to opt in to you know a system where you can request your bill at once and then get it for every future election it was worth it you know in the end it paid off prop 2 passed in Michigan by a large margin and Tudor Dixon lost but even if she hadn't because of prop 2 Michigan's Constitution now contains an explicit promise to the state citizens that their votes will be counted I'm passionate about voting rights I know what my ancestors went through so I'm here to fight for democracy and uh I'll be here until I guess I leave this earth the issue of voting free from interference was front and center in Arizona too I have been so pleased to hear of all you Vigilantes out there that want to camp out at these drop boxes right Carrie Lake one of the candidates for Arizona governor tweeted her support for this surveillance project smile you might be on camera so we're gonna have people parked out there watching you and they're going to follow you to your car and get your license plate it's gonna happen she was right it did happen armed Vigilantes dressed in tactical gear guys and body armor carrying guns and taking your picture pole stalkers people who've been staking out ballot drop boxes under the guise of preventing widespread voter fraud people spoke up they dropped off their ballots and then they filed complaints with the Secretary of State there's a group of people hanging out near the ballot Dropbox filming and photographing my wife and I as we approach the Dropbox and accusing us of being a mule camo Cloud people taking pictures of me and my license plate as I dropped our mail-in ballots in the Box a pro-democracy group filed a lawsuit and the judge issued a temporary restraining order the people voted and Kerry Lake lost by a very small margin the ballot drop boxes she threatened to remove the early voting she threatened to cut off they're both safe for now the US doesn't have one big election it has over 3 000 small elections run mostly by Volunteers in high school gyms and libraries and community centers and that can make it easy for some politicians to cast doubt on their efficacy out of self-interest but it also means that anyone who cares about making them actually work can go from a bystander to an active participant in the fight to keep democracy alive and well anyone can go from standing in line to standing behind the table thank you guys so much for watching one of the
