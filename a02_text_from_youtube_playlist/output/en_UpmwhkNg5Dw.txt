this is the state of Florida hang on I'm just going to zoom out okay this is a chart of how every US state voted for president in the year 2000 Democrat States here Republican states here and then some really close States and then Florida maybe you know the story one of the closest elections in American history Florida to close to call in Florida Bush clinging to a 130th of 1% lead this is a wild woolly and weird situation George liy Bush won Florida that year by 537 votes and left Florida with reputation as not just the quintessential swing state but also a bellweather state that would predict how the election as a whole would go and over the next few elections it did voting for Republicans Democrats then Republicans then Republicans again even though a Democrat won the election that year and in the 2022 elections which were sort of disappointing for Republicans overall Florida would reelect its Republican Governor Ronda in a landslide biggest win for a republican governor in the state here in modern history Republicans would also win 2/3 super majorities in both houses of the state's legislature and Florida Republicans have been busy Banning transgender girls from female sports so called don't say gay law stop woke act bans race related Concepts bill that would ban abortions after 6 weeks of pregnancy what used to be a swing state is now deeply conservative it's gotten even redder since the last election is Florida now a solid red state I love this state today the idea of Florida as a swing state feels like a distant memory so what [Music] changed so in this video we're going to look at three explanations for why Florida turned red but first we should look at what turned red really means in this case because even though Florida has swung in presidential elections for the past 20 years every Governor it's elected has been a republican same with every attorney general it's elected this chart which shows how Florida's voted in the past six presidential elections seems to show a lot of variation Republicans win some years Democrats win others but stay with me if you add how the whole country voted onto this chart and compare that with Florida you see that in every election Florida voted more Republican than the country in general and if you just chart the gap between Florida and the US that looks like this and what we're interested in is this this big jump where Florida goes from voting about three or four percentage points more Republican than the country to 8 percentage points more Republican the vicinity of about 2020 anyone remember anything about that [Music] year between the beginning of the pandemic and the 2022 mid term elections about 4 million registered voters in the US moved to a new state about one out of every seven of those voters ended up in Florida that's a lot and if we look at what political party those new Florida voters are now registered to we see a lot more Republicans than Democrats and you can really see that if we compare it to the other states that also got a lot of new residents during the pandemic so Georgia California North Carolina Texas there is an outlier here that is a lot of Republicans moving to Florida during the pandemic so that's our first explanation and it's definitely one the conservatives have highlighted a lot of people leave these other states and come to Florida because of the policies of the state legislature lockdowns have driven some people to Florida who just had enough arst policies were not nearly as restrictive as they were in New York and California people remember that but this story actually only gets us part of the way there because this margin is about 100,000 people that's a lot but in 2022 about 8 million people voted in Florida those new voters not enough to really swing an election so we need to keep looking this is Miami Dade County the biggest County in Florida and one of the most left leaning in 2016 it voted for Hillary Clinton by about 30 percentage points in 2018 the Democratic candidate for governor won up by about 20 points then in 2020 Joe Biden only won the county by about seven points and in 2022 the Republican candidate for governor won in Miami Dade County this is a pretty big shift but if you look at who lives in Miami Dade there's a clue nationally Latino voters have mostly voted for Democrats in recent elections and they also used to in Florida which is about a quarter Latino but not anymore in 2022 the states Latino voters went firmly for republicans Latinos in Florida are voting more Republican than before and voting more Republican than Latinos elsewhere in the US these are the seven states with the largest Latino populations in the us together they make up 2/3 of the country's Latino population and here is how those populations break down in terms of what the US Census calls specific origin you can see two Trends here in the southwest and Midwest Latino populations are mostly Mexican in the Northeast they're more Puerto Rican and Dominican but Florida is a whole different story with not just a large Cuban population but sizable and growing populations from Venezuela and Colombia and Republicans have gone after those communities hard with messaging like this ad from 2022 or this ad from 20120 which linked Joe Biden to the Socialist leaders of the country's many floridans have come from I'm going to be good to go down one most Progressive presidents in American history and you can see what might be the success of that approach if you zoom into Miami day to for example the city of halia which is about 75% Cuban they have voted for Democrats at a lower and lower rate since 2016 or the city of Dural which is majority Venezuelan and Colombian same thing for whom I vote Republican of course coming from Cuba we all know what communism and socialism looks like Donald Trump the values he stands for for me it's the same B I share Cala she's horrible she is socialist now there's also been speculation that disinformation among Spanish speaking Floridians played a role in 2020 and 2022 but that is kind of hard to quantify anyway this chart kind of offers a simpler explanation it shows us Republican spending on Spanish language advertising in the 2022 governor's race compared to how much Democrats spent you might interpret this Gap as one side was going much harder than the other side you wouldn't be wrong here is a kind of similar chart this one shows all the money spent by the state parties in Florida since 2021 at the peak of the last election Florida Republicans spent more than $60 million in a single quarter Democrats spent a little less than 8 million and get used to seeing big red bars cuz it's hard to overstate how strong Florida's state Republican party is it's the best funded State party in the country country and it's not even really close in 2022 the Republican party of Florida raised over $140 million Florida Democrats raised 27 million especially compared to Florida Republicans Florida Democrats are in bad shape Florida has always had more registered Democrats than registered Republicans but that ended in 2021 and not only that there's actually a third group that's not far behind registered voters with no party affiliation if we just look at the new voter registrations since 2020 that group actually outnumbers registrations for both parties now let's separate it out by age look at how many younger people in Florida are registering as no party those are voters that the Florida Democratic party is just missing when the 2022 election results came in it wasn't just Governor Dan santis who wanted a landslide Senator Marco Rubio and the Republican candidate for attorney general ran up similar margins it's just a a blood bath boom boom boom one of the worst midterm elections for Democrats in decades really cannot be overstated how poorly Democrats performed look at how many people are here to see Ron de santis look at this I love him we love him we need in Florida great to be here gathered in the red county of Miami day [Applause] these are not the only reasons Florida has become a red State there's the undeniable impact of Donald Trump Who currently himself lives in Florida and is also extremely motivating to a subset of Voters that are very well represented there also though Republicans have just kind of run better campaigns with more popular candidates one thing that means is that Florida doesn't actually need to be a totally lost cause for Democrats this chart shows how much the national Democratic party along with its Senate and House election committees spent on candidates in Florida over the past few elections in 2022 that spending on Florida dropped almost to zero you can see the moment when National Democrats chose to kind of give up on Florida and start spending that money elsewhere in places where they had a better chance of winning so we don't know when Florida will swing back again or if it ever will but if you wanted to imagine what that would look like we do know where to [Music] start hi thank you for watching I'm Adam I made this video along with Melissa and Steph and Matt and we made this video because we wanted to figure out a satisfying answer to the question of how did Florida become a red State we didn't really see one out there yet and it took a fair amount of research we had to call people track down raw data interview more people to help make sense of that data we had to you know do journalism to it we had to report it out I don't know if I would call it groundbreaking work but any kind of original reporting compared to your standard Rabbit Hole of YouTube videos Wikipedia articles just takes more time it takes more resources right this is why a lot of what you can watch and read for free on the internet is often either a repackaging of already available information or it is opinion and it's also why a lot of the original reporting on the internet increasingly is just blocked behind a pay wall this video is actually part of a larger project of Vox that was funded by Vox contributors people who want to keep Fox's journalism free and help us do better and more ambitious work the project is all about Florida it's really good we'll put a link to it in the description if you would like to support us you can go to vox.com now any amount you give will help us keep doing journalism that you can watch for free I cover the us next year there is yet another election in the US and we want to cover it in a way that feels relevant and fresh but that also clarifies the stakes of it on actual people's lives and we want it to be as accessible as possible we have a goal of 85,00 total contributions by the end of this year and to stay on Pace for that requires 2500 new contributions this month you can help get to that goal at box.com now thank you for staying with me for all that and thank you again for watching
